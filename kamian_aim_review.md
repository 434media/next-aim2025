  ## Main Page Ideas
- Bring "From the Bench to the Battlefield" to the top. 
-In the main menu create a dropdown for "Past Summits" and put AIM 2025 info in that section
- Make the most recent, i.e. AIM 2025 a small highlight at the bottom. Put the Thnak you messeage at the botoom then turn the "Relive the Moments" text into a button that takes you to the "Past Summits" page where users can then navigate to the 2025 information
- Add the "Why attend" info to the main page (reduce info to make it more concise as to avoid too muuch words)
