457e0970-4eac-4ce8-961b-7e244a0a7d8d-1
00:06:50.563 --> 00:06:52.080
participating in this program.

27309388-41a0-4af2-bac8-d93c3ea18724-0
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.480
Also today's session being forwarded.

a9a682b4-4045-4906-afbc-ae13eb138651-0
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.724
Just want to make sure everyone
understands that and accepts it for the

a9a682b4-4045-4906-afbc-ae13eb138651-1
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:01.040
report.

f4c8d028-0bb2-45fa-8df7-bcc3c13128c3-0
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.000
And that's more of them and then
everything here today.

23b42037-de43-44b8-a12d-70ea06635a3d-0
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.123
I'll go ahead and give a disclaimer for
everybody that's going to be

23b42037-de43-44b8-a12d-70ea06635a3d-1
00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:12.145
participating so we can skip over that
With each of the presenters that that

23b42037-de43-44b8-a12d-70ea06635a3d-2
00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:15.383
they're providing to you is their vast
information available,

23b42037-de43-44b8-a12d-70ea06635a3d-3
00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:19.040
which may or may may not be reflective of
their parent organizations.

f336f2d8-0c04-4b65-a3f7-7ec5bdd9b0d3-0
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.960
So mom and dad,
everybody else and that would work.

4803fc94-0bec-4f89-8d7f-6f75781291da-0
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.120
I wanted to ask if you have a
representative from SURF.

972bdbe0-9eb4-446f-bab1-87900912eb3b-0
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.640
SURF is also being held in consumption as
part of it mean confidence.

3245324a-2ae8-48cd-bfa7-b0340bc841f0-0
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.560
Does anybody OK well in that I wanted to
mention a little bit about SURF.

d58aed4a-acf6-4d49-9d8f-84e2a215458b-0
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.736
SURF has been going on for people 11
years now but it's the San Antonio

d58aed4a-acf6-4d49-9d8f-84e2a215458b-1
00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:46.544
Military Health System University
Research Forum as you are now and it was

d58aed4a-acf6-4d49-9d8f-84e2a215458b-2
00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:50.840
a lot of the students who present great
information research base.

161e5861-1def-4f9d-968d-0b415a541e66-0
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.473
It also gives you a chance to get
interactive engagement because today and

161e5861-1def-4f9d-968d-0b415a541e66-1
00:07:56.473 --> 00:08:01.866
as well as the next one that Patty
mentioned and the actual importance has

161e5861-1def-4f9d-968d-0b415a541e66-2
00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:03.520
something for everyone.

57d6a2e8-215a-4397-8816-dd8ca7a025e6-0
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.215
There's just so much information that's
been provided,

57d6a2e8-215a-4397-8816-dd8ca7a025e6-1
00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:11.500
but today it's going to give us an
introduction of the DH as venture

57d6a2e8-215a-4397-8816-dd8ca7a025e6-2
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.679
disclosure process.

8756a5d7-86d8-4186-98b0-1f80170a458a-0
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.772
That's very important because it helps if
you're online today or watching this

8756a5d7-86d8-4186-98b0-1f80170a458a-1
00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:24.470
later and you're thinking about, hey,
that's a good ideas from military or my

8756a5d7-86d8-4186-98b0-1f80170a458a-2
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.639
family provider.

cdeab799-d500-41b8-98da-08369efc5c37-0
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.872
DHA has a great process that she'll go
over on how to get invention disclosure

cdeab799-d500-41b8-98da-08369efc5c37-1
00:08:31.872 --> 00:08:32.520
submitted.

d234a299-beff-4b90-8c74-8add029513e8-0
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.600
And it's an entry level.

679274e0-3d49-4257-91fd-2144b2cdd649-0
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.773
So when we can build off that knowledge,
if you're academia,

679274e0-3d49-4257-91fd-2144b2cdd649-1
00:08:37.773 --> 00:08:41.663
a lot of good information today is going
to be presented on how you can work with

679274e0-3d49-4257-91fd-2144b2cdd649-2
00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:42.280
the military.

56541631-a681-4bce-a0df-7375b79a5b37-0
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.080
And when I say military,
it also includes government civilian

56541631-a681-4bce-a0df-7375b79a5b37-1
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.920
research to secure ID jointly.

37804d73-2874-49dd-89e1-e861fc4f5b76-0
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.582
And then the third of course is we really
want to target businesses that first make

37804d73-2874-49dd-89e1-e861fc4f5b76-1
00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:55.200
sure you're aware of it.

29e981fa-cd97-4790-93f9-ea5776bc4621-0
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.939
We have a lot of great influential
property in devices that are used to

29e981fa-cd97-4790-93f9-ea5776bc4621-1
00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.240
develop new products.

9ee72c54-1007-421d-9588-92373e14d0cd-0
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.393
And today we're going to discuss a lot of
public engagement,

9ee72c54-1007-421d-9588-92373e14d0cd-1
00:09:05.393 --> 00:09:10.081
how to identify and engage and then
secure that and then also utilizing that

9ee72c54-1007-421d-9588-92373e14d0cd-2
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:11.360
influential property.

af6ad62f-66f6-4711-98c9-57ea48967c04-0
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.960
And then some of your proposals,
you don't necessarily have to license it

af6ad62f-66f6-4711-98c9-57ea48967c04-1
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.480
to submit a proposal say to app works.

8082e688-9dd9-4d30-919b-08c8a3adc817-0
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.554
So that's the RSCTR,
you can reference it or you can approach

8082e688-9dd9-4d30-919b-08c8a3adc817-1
00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:22.920
which we have a representative from.

32c38692-3c96-42c2-9f1b-9b35385aa790-0
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.270
Secondly,
today we manage a lot of our in social

32c38692-3c96-42c2-9f1b-9b35385aa790-1
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:26.680
property.

73401942-eeaf-4b35-9710-4baed1966b85-0
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.266
By the time you can add that to your
proposal that show reviewers that you've

73401942-eeaf-4b35-9710-4baed1966b85-1
00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:34.609
done the research,
there's a kind of insult to property out

73401942-eeaf-4b35-9710-4baed1966b85-2
00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:36.560
there that you're going to utilize.

489de007-f3d0-4347-8a8c-ef5e048e6b87-0
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.907
And the other thing about military
generating social property,

489de007-f3d0-4347-8a8c-ef5e048e6b87-1
00:09:40.907 --> 00:09:46.084
there's a there's a mark because a lot of
our in social property is based on me,

489de007-f3d0-4347-8a8c-ef5e048e6b87-2
00:09:46.084 --> 00:09:50.239
the necessity that a provider,
she or he's working on something.

f5701550-5963-4090-a034-815f05cfd157-0
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.480
I wish I had this or I hadn't been this
to make them work.

11cbb0bd-33cc-49ad-86bc-7bcad5792553-0
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.480
That's the influential problem that can
be secure and then soon later.

7180e317-8e51-456c-ab76-c429085028e8-0
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.880
So again,
appreciate everyone that's on call.

189b45da-7c9b-48e2-b235-e132059694af-0
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.800
We need to keep going.

4d6d5124-918e-4c78-bbea-6bed20cb033d-0
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.280
So I'm going to turn it over.

cb7103fa-bf5f-4e28-97ea-7aaafa6ac695-0
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.120
I think the first speaker is Marlena.

79f0d2ba-90f8-4972-a29b-c9fd03731e62-0
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.560
Marlena, can you introduce yourself,
please?

00b0d1a6-7831-44a0-b0f1-24cb5e7112df-0
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.120
Yes.

6beee061-1cb6-4104-858b-03ce7df02c8a-0
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.600
Good morning, everyone.

68c53dca-a4ef-4aad-9ee9-09c7b956ac63-0
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.520
Can I do a quick comms check?

824110e5-1434-437e-8618-9b5942d11332-0
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.920
Can you hear me OK?

0ec334f3-88b5-42a2-9c0b-cc5b188c2921-0
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.080
Yes, we can hear you.

464665ff-3def-4883-ac34-9518c6d23024-0
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.280
OK.

712713da-75a7-4a8d-a520-0c20a3adb0d1-0
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.680
Thank you so much.

022bfe74-a80e-4f31-b3b5-d06bef4f437f-0
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.760
And until my bandwidth gets too weak,
I'll keep my camera on.

f339c01e-2be8-43ae-b120-4fb0f3ce76c9-0
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.640
So all right, good morning everyone.

cc0d6202-25b8-487e-bc57-b48ee255a36a-0
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.624
Thank you so much for having me today and
really quick because I think I only have

cc0d6202-25b8-487e-bc57-b48ee255a36a-1
00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:41.748
10 minutes to to give you a high level
overview,

cc0d6202-25b8-487e-bc57-b48ee255a36a-2
00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:48.312
but I'm a patent attorney at DHA Office
of General Counsel and we have a shop

cc0d6202-25b8-487e-bc57-b48ee255a36a-3
00:10:48.312 --> 00:10:55.129
that all of basically all the medical IP
or most of the medical IP coming out of

cc0d6202-25b8-487e-bc57-b48ee255a36a-4
00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:56.560
the armed forces.

171a56d8-9552-423b-8bb3-78cfcac3b981-0
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.280
So next slide, please.

d0daa6c3-b9e7-4d38-9b8b-8d90de0a904c-0
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.724
OK,
so where are the medical innovations

d0daa6c3-b9e7-4d38-9b8b-8d90de0a904c-1
00:11:05.724 --> 00:11:08.880
coming from that reach our office?

e35c0c03-c9d8-49cc-a179-e4ea3a7a8a88-0
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.800
And many of you will know these people
because we're in collaboration with you.

454501fe-0f16-4f16-a5d6-35d2a80d721c-0
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.798
The Army provides most of the the things
that we come, that we come across,

454501fe-0f16-4f16-a5d6-35d2a80d721c-1
00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:25.640
and that's because it's a a monster of
research.

aa7e587f-5b72-4f9f-bb57-7cc4dd325498-0
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.273
We have 10 labs,
including powers like Walter Reed Army

aa7e587f-5b72-4f9f-bb57-7cc4dd325498-1
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:37.920
Institute of Research and Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases.

620b9a2d-217c-4904-991e-c29487c99fa9-0
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.960
We have a global footprint and we do a
lot of work.

35f27f91-6139-4dbd-917e-2db94c8fd326-0
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.000
We get out, we we get a lot of IP,
believe it or not,

35f27f91-6139-4dbd-917e-2db94c8fd326-1
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.480
out of Thailand and Africa.

db04f2d3-7c44-48a0-afd1-87d3cda3317c-0
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.480
We also support the Air Force.

6a02e73f-854c-49e9-ac74-587bf7103bfa-0
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.611
They have a number of labs, the Navy,
we will probably be supporting them and

6a02e73f-854c-49e9-ac74-587bf7103bfa-1
00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:02.080
uniformed services,
typo should be services.

99b83b04-4a39-4dcf-ab41-8afbd03de51b-0
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.720
University has a training facility and we
get a lot out of there.

3900c438-0b87-4b26-b636-b66d52cdfb6b-0
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.462
And of course,
DHA has lots of hospitals and,

3900c438-0b87-4b26-b636-b66d52cdfb6b-1
00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:15.344
but most of the IP,
if any come out of the medical training

3900c438-0b87-4b26-b636-b66d52cdfb6b-2
00:12:15.344 --> 00:12:16.240
facilities.

05d45023-dc37-4d03-80cd-671bc3fd4639-0
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.850
OK,
that's and and many of you will be

05d45023-dc37-4d03-80cd-671bc3fd4639-1
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.976
already in knowledgeable of these places
because you're in collaborations with

05d45023-dc37-4d03-80cd-671bc3fd4639-2
00:12:24.976 --> 00:12:26.080
some of our labs.

6c2e89da-9bfb-4d62-b09e-27ac62d230d9-0
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.760
All right, next slide please.

d1831916-1cd9-471f-afd5-fb1d77e20f03-0
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:37.280
So what is the life cycle of army or
medical, any sort of military medical IP?

b205ab6e-ed4a-48bb-baaf-2888e64b3008-0
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.434
Well,
this is a really simple slide because I

b205ab6e-ed4a-48bb-baaf-2888e64b3008-1
00:12:40.434 --> 00:12:44.445
only had a few minutes,
but just so you can see how it how we see

b205ab6e-ed4a-48bb-baaf-2888e64b3008-2
00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:47.240
it and you could fit in nicely here,
I think.

df7e8495-8306-4671-abf9-ae66ed2031ef-0
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.385
So our medical research will hopefully
lead to an innovation and then we our

df7e8495-8306-4671-abf9-ae66ed2031ef-1
00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:58.950
office gets involved right away as we
like to get involved as soon as possible

df7e8495-8306-4671-abf9-ae66ed2031ef-2
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.446
because we're trying to forego or get
ahead of any publications and just also

df7e8495-8306-4671-abf9-ae66ed2031ef-3
00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:06.560
work with any of our partners.

7f62cc11-c283-4546-968e-5f07a34465f1-0
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.200
So where it goes with there.

c8b47415-02df-4e47-8362-02d60f56980d-0
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.280
So we'll engage our process in the next
slides.

02edb379-af84-48d1-9488-dbad91b69d1e-0
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:16.165
We'll tell talk about that a little bit,
but you can see that we will also engage

02edb379-af84-48d1-9488-dbad91b69d1e-1
00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:21.477
without licensing and my esteemed
colleague Barry Datloff will inform you

02edb379-af84-48d1-9488-dbad91b69d1e-2
00:13:21.477 --> 00:13:23.200
of that in a little bit.

8a15ae19-70f0-46c1-bde7-2edb172443aa-0
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.280
We'd have some capability to develop a
little bit in house.

60e15b19-d782-45b1-8b9f-bc6de12a7c54-0
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:33.640
We actually have officer regulated
activity and that can be an FDA sponsor.

941e9c52-340a-4076-a3dd-5bc1e4858bba-0
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.040
But as you all know, we we don't want it.

9ef697ce-5118-4cd2-82b5-98d066fdc6ea-0
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.360
We don't go too far with that.

31904f41-28d3-4e6c-aee0-a1bb18edc7d5-0
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.296
We really need,
I'd like to work with academia and

31904f41-28d3-4e6c-aee0-a1bb18edc7d5-1
00:13:42.296 --> 00:13:48.625
industry to have commercial partners and
if necessary even a procurement contract

31904f41-28d3-4e6c-aee0-a1bb18edc7d5-2
00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:49.320
contract.

2f37ee58-7109-42cd-be68-bef50bb74ddf-0
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.480
So at the end of that,
you can see the nice blue text.

40a61c24-ab78-4755-8b7a-040cb982fefd-0
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.280
It's a field of medical capability and
that's always our goal.

81e65ac5-1872-42a2-a905-4cc0ba8957c8-0
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.680
OK, next slide please.

0ca4e9b2-953d-4b9b-8d06-7e8b2aaef7a8-0
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.640
All right.

9b65a21e-35be-4f41-a072-594a649fb7f3-0
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.000
So what is our process?

ef4fc93f-ccb0-4453-97ec-940aa313e3af-0
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.021
And I think this slide got a little
messed up,

ef4fc93f-ccb0-4453-97ec-940aa313e3af-1
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:11.440
but I'll try to read through it.

d851399b-2488-4919-86e1-6c7fc6f2422c-0
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:18.186
So we have rather a robust process and I
haven't actually heard of been working

d851399b-2488-4919-86e1-6c7fc6f2422c-1
00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:21.560
with them for over 30 years on 25 years.

a089b21a-d179-48eb-aa8c-b97ed9971881-0
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.050
Sorry,
I don't want to date myself too much and

a089b21a-d179-48eb-aa8c-b97ed9971881-1
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.560
and I haven't seen anything like it
really in the DoD anyway.

65305612-ece2-41ab-bd1b-10e5f458f2c7-0
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.156
So we have an invention intake team and
I'm part of that,

65305612-ece2-41ab-bd1b-10e5f458f2c7-1
00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:36.000
I supervise some of that.

a7eb536f-67c0-4059-9698-9039e3cbcb19-0
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.080
And we have a robust process with our
invention disclosure forms like many of

a7eb536f-67c0-4059-9698-9039e3cbcb19-1
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.440
you have for your institutions as well.

70bff387-8b65-469a-9d63-64e5bcda1431-0
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.040
And we do a lot of work before it goes
anywhere.

a5308222-32e4-4d17-a083-7ab141bafda6-0
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.694
And we'll see if it's sufficiently
developed, you know,

a5308222-32e4-4d17-a083-7ab141bafda6-1
00:14:50.694 --> 00:14:53.240
what is the technology readiness level.

185fad3c-026c-4c86-8e83-3c8a8c0c8712-0
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.898
And if it looks like it's, hey, we,
we got something here,

185fad3c-026c-4c86-8e83-3c8a8c0c8712-1
00:14:56.898 --> 00:15:00.350
we have some decent data and we'll make
sure some of the so,

185fad3c-026c-4c86-8e83-3c8a8c0c8712-2
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.840
so we package it up so that it makes
sense.

7ea93ac1-30a4-442a-aa32-cc9b8df53235-0
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.360
I'll also do an inventorship assessment.

4bbf7369-55f7-4370-8849-e4f74557aa9c-0
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.760
And as everyone knows,
ownership follows inventorship.

52753fac-113e-43ef-9817-bfea66d62bd3-0
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.331
And the relevance of that is if we have a
partner such as somebody that we have a

52753fac-113e-43ef-9817-bfea66d62bd3-1
00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:20.320
crater with,
they could probably will be a co-owner.

c07bcacd-f223-4f4a-8ae7-2558ffe8660a-0
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.231
And so then we'll get into, you know,
buy Dole rights,

c07bcacd-f223-4f4a-8ae7-2558ffe8660a-1
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:28.997
which is a whole nother slideshow,
but I'll we'll handle all that and we

c07bcacd-f223-4f4a-8ae7-2558ffe8660a-2
00:15:28.997 --> 00:15:33.698
work with anyone we transfer over if it's
a vital, if they elect title,

c07bcacd-f223-4f4a-8ae7-2558ffe8660a-3
00:15:33.698 --> 00:15:38.725
then our process is going to stop and
we'll work with the the partner to get

c07bcacd-f223-4f4a-8ae7-2558ffe8660a-4
00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:39.639
them on board.

b34aac72-3e88-492e-abf6-6dcfc4a97503-0
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.160
So either way,
we're pretty robust about it.

0c13027f-dc67-48db-8f24-27e75254fe91-0
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.563
So after that,
let's just say it it gets gets where it

0c13027f-dc67-48db-8f24-27e75254fe91-1
00:15:44.563 --> 00:15:45.000
should go.

abd382ac-a5d9-4703-8e1e-4752b0baa51e-0
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.596
So it'll get, if it passes all that,
it'll be put in our queue for the

abd382ac-a5d9-4703-8e1e-4752b0baa51e-1
00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:53.040
Invention Evaluation Committee.

87258abd-55fc-494f-9fc2-073c2de989db-0
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.000
And we meet about once a month,
sometimes if necessary, twice.

15e09dac-83d3-418d-924e-2bc9867bf45e-0
00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.040
And this takes several hours and lots of
resources and time.

6235bcff-b94e-4c9a-89d2-458c853a22bf-0
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.592
Go into that meeting,
we'll have a prior art search

6235bcff-b94e-4c9a-89d2-458c853a22bf-1
00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:05.480
commissioned.

693fe591-0634-484e-bbe3-c116d919752b-0
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.920
I will do a patentability assessment
based on that.

f57423a0-a5c6-4959-86eb-4f5175876e5c-0
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.433
We will assess licensing potential and
and Barry will talk a little bit about

f57423a0-a5c6-4959-86eb-4f5175876e5c-1
00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:16.800
that.

300d122f-73f9-44ce-a73b-093fcc006ebb-0
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.920
So it's really a team effort.

009ff073-b2c8-4a15-b1ac-33699f2d24b8-0
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.280
Our inventors get involved.

7b15175c-1bd2-44de-b66b-b17ced9fbf1d-0
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.560
We have a lot of meetings outside of that
in advance of the meeting.

8228a5d2-647e-44a6-b4dd-b8d04239706a-0
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.613
And then we'll have a large committee
meeting and we will all discuss

8228a5d2-647e-44a6-b4dd-b8d04239706a-1
00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:28.520
everything and come to a consensus.

88bda806-7a2c-4554-86cb-f46bdf0a8d26-0
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.240
Some of the things about what to do.

bde967f0-b75f-4193-956a-1474a20a1ca9-0
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.440
So some of the things you look obviously
is as likely patentable.

fca55e1d-a6ba-406e-968e-d2e7b2044b82-0
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.360
If I have a bad search report, you know,
I'm going to have to tell them.

7884d077-835f-4a80-869c-bc817f2df37f-0
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.560
But we usually try to work at least we'll
see the priority.

c9e1461b-e9c5-4002-bba5-4eac4ab93473-0
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.880
We'll work around it if we can see what
we have.

b776bc36-a846-42f7-98bd-0a86a9dfada8-0
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.071
So what we can reasonably expect,
because we're going to pour a lot of

b776bc36-a846-42f7-98bd-0a86a9dfada8-1
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:46.880
resources into it.

39e2f6b2-6d74-4f8a-a442-ef4b408aa3f2-0
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.440
Is it licensable?

805cf84d-7693-45be-af39-91dbf1039da6-0
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.000
Barry's team will assess this.

331d3ca2-9e37-415e-91ee-64338a9490be-0
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.560
And we consider things like,
does it fulfill a military mission?

6a89f326-121c-4d1f-b32a-538f19ddd811-0
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.360
And we really like it when it's dual use.

188deeb7-1edc-4280-bf01-5b8ab0a041a6-0
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.560
And you can imagine that most medical IP
often has at least civilian use as well.

925fc4ce-f174-4ae7-b11d-a829942171d6-0
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.711
And that's really fantastic because it
just gets the science that world do the

925fc4ce-f174-4ae7-b11d-a829942171d6-1
00:17:10.711 --> 00:17:11.960
most good software.

164b2b46-ca71-47c1-9d28-1403dd738d85-0
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.400
We we have a couple options for software.

f7f60506-4a76-4539-b555-fa3f6a1cd61e-0
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.752
Sometimes a patent isn't the best way if
that's the main component of the

f7f60506-4a76-4539-b555-fa3f6a1cd61e-1
00:17:18.752 --> 00:17:19.400
innovation.

910b08f8-8115-4abd-9666-6cb11f6672be-0
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.576
At the end of the process,
at the end of the meeting,

910b08f8-8115-4abd-9666-6cb11f6672be-1
00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:26.640
I should say we've decided one way or the
other.

99559612-a442-4e33-8f87-47c693824a05-0
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.600
Usually we're going to go forward and
file or maybe not.

5d8d541a-b978-4535-942c-d0d41408e4dc-0
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:38.000
So a lot of resources go into our process
and we it's working out pretty well.

db2eb03a-9a8f-449b-b2f9-b088ba27f8ee-0
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.258
We we still have room to grow,
especially given the fact that we are

db2eb03a-9a8f-449b-b2f9-b088ba27f8ee-1
00:17:42.258 --> 00:17:44.480
processing more and more these days.

7bfd85e5-76d9-4781-9cb2-2836b9f1f411-0
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.000
OK, next slide please.

fd40f3f8-7d55-4f68-8821-063069f0155f-0
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.320
All right.

bd973c52-635d-47a5-9b1a-430bdbd89d21-0
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.600
So just a little bit of context for
metrics, if anyone likes those numbers.

a657ecd8-79d0-4a0f-904d-34204302b22f-0
00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:02.368
So it comes perhaps we get to,
to me usually, often the researchers,

a657ecd8-79d0-4a0f-904d-34204302b22f-1
00:18:02.368 --> 00:18:05.160
they, they know us by now.

54ebddc8-729e-402d-9c75-bb71d680a116-0
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.000
They'll just send me an e-mail and say,
hey, I think I have something.

112b9327-ba94-4aa4-a50b-34fbd8355779-0
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.205
Our wonderful orders,
our lab tech transfer teams are also on

112b9327-ba94-4aa4-a50b-34fbd8355779-1
00:18:13.205 --> 00:18:14.000
top of it.

918bda8c-d562-4baa-9b36-9f042a06e8e1-0
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.347
And we in the past couple years,
we've also started pre publication

918bda8c-d562-4baa-9b36-9f042a06e8e1-1
00:18:19.347 --> 00:18:22.766
reviews,
scanning for anything that looks like

918bda8c-d562-4baa-9b36-9f042a06e8e1-2
00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:26.040
it's something we ought to pay attention
to.

ebbf65fb-b0dc-4956-bd7f-0c3c208fbaa7-0
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.520
And this takes a lot of time as well.

4c30f5d2-81d8-44ac-b350-54f87b93758f-0
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.160
We do hundreds of these a year.

6d0d07b3-8ef2-462d-a046-a08f991f1986-0
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.098
What comes out is about after we've
curated everything about,

6d0d07b3-8ef2-462d-a046-a08f991f1986-1
00:18:35.098 --> 00:18:39.080
I'll say about 70 invention disclosure
forms a year.

70e63ebe-fa6a-4ad1-893c-8348d8cfab8b-0
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.377
And most of those, not all,
but most of those end up getting filed

70e63ebe-fa6a-4ad1-893c-8348d8cfab8b-1
00:18:45.377 --> 00:18:48.520
upon because we've tried to curate them
down.

06ad0b13-487a-42bb-b682-c24fd403847c-0
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.837
So by the time it hits the IEC meeting
that we were pretty good and then the

06ad0b13-487a-42bb-b682-c24fd403847c-1
00:18:53.837 --> 00:18:59.499
patent applications filed is about 100 a
year and why there's a disparity between

06ad0b13-487a-42bb-b682-c24fd403847c-2
00:18:59.499 --> 00:19:01.640
70 and 100 is not a one to one.

b2f60b08-d3d7-478e-9731-4842db2cdf98-0
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.151
As you probably know,
these may split one invented disclosure

b2f60b08-d3d7-478e-9731-4842db2cdf98-1
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:09.648
may split into multiple jurisdictions
such as you know,

b2f60b08-d3d7-478e-9731-4842db2cdf98-2
00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:14.518
if we file in the US which we would and
we might file also in Europe or other

b2f60b08-d3d7-478e-9731-4842db2cdf98-3
00:19:14.518 --> 00:19:16.080
jurisdictions from there.

7e6f1aa9-d4cf-4fe3-b436-df10f8f4faa6-0
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.400
So we're we're pretty busy shop overall.

1902eaa6-4112-4f2c-953a-56689ccf0fc3-0
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.800
Next slide, please.

b953c23c-9b9a-4118-bf41-023bedf6a172-0
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.876
So I was suggested that you might want to
know what,

b953c23c-9b9a-4118-bf41-023bedf6a172-1
00:19:29.876 --> 00:19:32.880
what about our inventors or anyone's
inventors.

f45635a5-16ce-4f90-9111-5d3c3188680c-0
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.522
So if it's the US inventors,
that's what I who I deal with most of the

f45635a5-16ce-4f90-9111-5d3c3188680c-1
00:19:38.522 --> 00:19:38.880
time.

44013900-3772-478b-bca3-22ff38badd03-0
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.120
Are they obligated to assign their rights
to the inventions to the US government?

687a56ae-f537-49b5-b8e0-8860f2246959-0
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.180
And yes,
almost always because their invention,

687a56ae-f537-49b5-b8e0-8860f2246959-1
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.833
if they're made during the normal course
of their job,

687a56ae-f537-49b5-b8e0-8860f2246959-2
00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:58.840
then employers usually like to reap the
fruit of their employees work.

7787d4d1-9e35-4e57-84fd-e47c579c9e38-0
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.400
And usually that's OK with everybody
because that's why they're working there.

fb8013af-d59c-441c-aeb0-37c02d134581-0
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.960
They're very happy to work with us.

c6afee3d-969c-4d69-82b5-5fe4d1743505-0
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.640
And so and Canon.

d1105036-716a-4dfb-aa44-b017de7d65f6-0
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.146
But but sometimes, you know,
can an inventor ever keep an invention

d1105036-716a-4dfb-aa44-b017de7d65f6-1
00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:15.480
they've made in the course of their
employment?

2b84b797-2ec6-49e9-b49d-4407cc2de2c0-0
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.560
At least for the US government.

f60832ea-599c-4477-b603-ea3b701821d5-0
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.480
And everyone has their own employment
contract, of course.

9e77b673-2932-490b-b57b-03b7650d4569-0
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.439
But in the US government, yes,
sometimes it's possible to do that,

9e77b673-2932-490b-b57b-03b7650d4569-1
00:20:24.439 --> 00:20:25.920
but it is a process.

e6411346-6652-445b-a939-1db42eceaff8-0
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.404
We, we're very,
we have a as like everything in the Army

e6411346-6652-445b-a939-1db42eceaff8-1
00:20:29.404 --> 00:20:33.440
military, we have a process, but we have,
we've done this before.

e1274bb5-234f-4ae0-8026-2d91a9f67452-0
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.467
And as a fact of fact, recently,
very recently,

e1274bb5-234f-4ae0-8026-2d91a9f67452-1
00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:41.640
we're in the process of licensing back a
bench scientist's invention back to him.

83e5355e-0ded-464f-b3ad-b588dd24a70d-0
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.594
And he has a he's retired and he has a
spin off company and he's going to

83e5355e-0ded-464f-b3ad-b588dd24a70d-1
00:20:45.594 --> 00:20:48.160
develop it and we're happy to help him do
that.

20a63e8b-fab2-4519-b088-2920248d2da5-0
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.353
So I think I've reached a probably a
little over my 10 minutes, but next slide,

20a63e8b-fab2-4519-b088-2920248d2da5-1
00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:53.720
please.

b5dfcc87-446d-4371-a709-719f5357083e-0
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.000
And I think that should be the end.

ce244975-e509-4814-816c-b507a5b658bb-0
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.160
All right.

97ca98b8-f3a0-47ae-94d5-a12b9f790a06-0
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.560
Well, I will think we'll hold questions,
right.

0b72bda8-e966-4381-94b1-6d072fdb4bbc-0
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.322
So I will so wait for any questions if
any and we can just move on to the next

0b72bda8-e966-4381-94b1-6d072fdb4bbc-1
00:21:04.322 --> 00:21:04.760
guest.

255c3c70-5a7d-4577-a29e-49b1d02c42f1-0
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.320
Thank you, Marlene.

329a97f6-42eb-4d17-9ed6-0c8f92a1087a-0
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.887
Yes, we are holding questions to the end,
but all questions into the chat and we

329a97f6-42eb-4d17-9ed6-0c8f92a1087a-1
00:21:10.887 --> 00:21:12.200
will take them at the end.

81e40e76-27ae-4976-95e6-bf1eee686f69-0
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.600
So thank you for that for your
presentation.

059519e8-9b78-43bf-9563-03a184118b5b-0
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.240
Our next presenter is Malcolm Cole.

b87c7c54-bf53-4e3a-a16e-2347bc920295-0
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:25.890
He is with Teckling and very important
that program, excuse me,

b87c7c54-bf53-4e3a-a16e-2347bc920295-1
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:32.280
with the military for binding and
licensees through there too.

f1e78375-41f9-4395-8817-19745fee402b-0
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.000
Go ahead, Mel.

016f1503-ab5a-4e07-af29-6f1df7763d7a-0
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.720
Thanks.

dd6aa017-e4b6-4f09-865a-fb8b62d8dd71-0
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.040
Quick, quick mic check.

fa14862d-344b-4d5f-8ec6-2cc1fa04c9a1-0
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.800
Can you hear me OK?

46500211-0ef1-4e6c-8a79-de205683615b-0
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.400
Yes, perfect.

606684e9-1cb3-4ed6-8ceb-d4ef2e6fd6d4-0
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.421
Well,
thanks Patty and Nicole for the

606684e9-1cb3-4ed6-8ceb-d4ef2e6fd6d4-1
00:21:42.421 --> 00:21:45.240
invitation to speak and for setting up
this webinar.

731269d1-01be-4240-a720-740a3fb19fd5-0
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.760
And hi, everyone.

fcf255b2-b8a2-4e09-8fae-0fc7fafaf56b-0
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.800
Thanks for coming to this.

106dc2dd-f420-4d31-9803-aca64ce3897a-0
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.320
My name is Malcolm.

9512d6d6-cd53-4b32-b253-c56621956599-0
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.880
I'm a senior technology manager with
Techlink.

8a84dac5-ec4f-4301-8cd1-28487fc9a308-0
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.450
We're a partnership intermediary
supporting the Department of Defense as

8a84dac5-ec4f-4301-8cd1-28487fc9a308-1
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.160
well as the VA.

7d95808b-f967-46f2-8d74-b893a8b1f4ea-0
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.914
And kind of the,
the focus of my talk is how,

7d95808b-f967-46f2-8d74-b893a8b1f4ea-1
00:22:00.914 --> 00:22:06.538
how can you find new opportunities to
collaborate with the DoD or to, you know,

7d95808b-f967-46f2-8d74-b893a8b1f4ea-2
00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:12.163
harness innovations coming out of the
federal government for the work that your

7d95808b-f967-46f2-8d74-b893a8b1f4ea-3
00:22:12.163 --> 00:22:13.640
own company is doing.

bc1b8397-4209-44cf-b498-3ad969d644d2-0
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.445
And we'll kind of go through a couple of
approaches that that that I've found

bc1b8397-4209-44cf-b498-3ad969d644d2-1
00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:20.360
success with.

e510cdf5-3621-4e40-bfbf-3de2dff329cf-0
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.000
A little bit about my organization.

808f1a57-4309-4aea-8e0d-9ee400e87a6d-0
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.960
Next slide.

768ec10f-3071-4892-9431-9bce2df389e4-0
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.640
So Tech Link is an authorized partnership
intermediary.

0cf08a4b-5d49-47c7-96b3-1fa53c4fd2ee-0
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.680
We support both the DoD and the VA.

b5b02c17-412d-4408-b86c-131fa64ed158-0
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.840
We work with companies that are
interested in partnering with those

b5b02c17-412d-4408-b86c-131fa64ed158-1
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.840
organizations both in identifying
technologies of interest.

d2420444-1734-41a2-a851-a594a5c3bf6c-0
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.464
We also provide support throughout the
licensing process,

d2420444-1734-41a2-a851-a594a5c3bf6c-1
00:22:40.464 --> 00:22:42.000
which I'll get into on the next slide.

dce736d3-54a9-4713-848c-fe05d113ff9e-0
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.002
We are fully funded through a contract
with the Air Force, our home institution,

dce736d3-54a9-4713-848c-fe05d113ff9e-1
00:22:48.002 --> 00:22:52.560
Montana State University and the Office
of the Under Secretary of Defense.

b3477725-8d82-4030-b721-9938d7115048-0
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.714
So all of our services are provided to
both the labs we support and to companies

b3477725-8d82-4030-b721-9938d7115048-1
00:22:57.714 --> 00:22:59.560
that work with us at no cost.

a4610383-949c-4939-a7f4-07b81e13d4da-0
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.720
And we have about 50 individuals,
wide range of backgrounds.

f1df7152-3af1-47da-b82f-cd8c06810c1e-0
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.673
Most of our technology managers have PhDs
or some sort of scientific background as

f1df7152-3af1-47da-b82f-cd8c06810c1e-1
00:23:11.673 --> 00:23:14.120
well as significant licensing experience.

75996ca5-6d7b-44a8-af19-243fc945a90c-0
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:14.880
Next slide.

786b9459-7562-4cac-9bf4-d6ebc12b49c9-0
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.092
So our our process,
we support you throughout the technology

786b9459-7562-4cac-9bf4-d6ebc12b49c9-1
00:23:20.092 --> 00:23:21.200
transfer process.

abf23e7e-4cf4-4dac-b737-178942b79f35-0
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.622
The kind of focus in my talk today will
be discovering opportunities to work with

abf23e7e-4cf4-4dac-b737-178942b79f35-1
00:23:25.622 --> 00:23:26.000
DoD IP.

e9bbc4a6-3ec7-49cc-98c0-bd11c21d75a5-0
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.429
We also help you evaluate that IP for
your company's needs,

e9bbc4a6-3ec7-49cc-98c0-bd11c21d75a5-1
00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:33.416
apply for a license agreement or other
intellectual property agreements to

e9bbc4a6-3ec7-49cc-98c0-bd11c21d75a5-2
00:23:33.416 --> 00:23:37.509
actually work with the labs and we help
you through the negotiation of those

e9bbc4a6-3ec7-49cc-98c0-bd11c21d75a5-3
00:23:37.509 --> 00:23:38.520
agreements as well.

019c5a35-cab3-42d3-a11b-77ae3b7a4275-0
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:45.037
We kind of serve as like a third party
honest broker to support both of you and

019c5a35-cab3-42d3-a11b-77ae3b7a4275-1
00:23:45.037 --> 00:23:47.400
the lab tech transfer office.

e63dcf39-8872-4855-880a-834d92dd9e84-0
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.563
But as I said today,
focus will be on this first step

e63dcf39-8872-4855-880a-834d92dd9e84-1
00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:53.240
discovering IP next slide.

3a2f357a-5ea6-4536-8c92-e951f2d9162e-0
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.240
So how to find opportunities for
collaboration.

bfbf722e-37a7-4062-bdad-f7f5679e56ac-0
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.505
So let's say you're interested in Co
developing new IP or maybe you have a

bfbf722e-37a7-4062-bdad-f7f5679e56ac-1
00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:08.737
product or some background IP that you'd
like to work with a lab to help validate

bfbf722e-37a7-4062-bdad-f7f5679e56ac-2
00:24:08.737 --> 00:24:09.120
there.

6c2ebdf5-1b35-4c73-884a-625fc7da973b-0
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.902
There's a few,
I'd say good resources to to find these

6c2ebdf5-1b35-4c73-884a-625fc7da973b-1
00:24:11.902 --> 00:24:12.600
opportunities.

c72f3b80-d12f-48de-ba6c-5e48308316fc-0
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.360
One is research lab websites.

f3113538-29e9-457a-99bb-8babaadfcd40-0
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.160
So here is the Air Force research labs
website.

4706b087-537e-4f19-9c72-521fd51951d8-0
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.080
Next slide.

aff57f74-4200-4667-ab05-7feed0809beb-0
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.880
Here is the website for the Army research
lab.

7bcadf1e-1d92-4fb9-9d48-337726f1446e-0
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.320
And next slide and here's for Army
Medical's web page.

347e1cd7-a993-4f41-a986-e38c65d28379-0
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.974
Generally these are if you kind of just
Google the lab and look for something

347e1cd7-a993-4f41-a986-e38c65d28379-1
00:24:36.974 --> 00:24:42.043
that says collaborate or working with the
lab from a businesses perspective,

347e1cd7-a993-4f41-a986-e38c65d28379-2
00:24:42.043 --> 00:24:46.717
the labs will generally post a lot of
opportunities for collaboration,

347e1cd7-a993-4f41-a986-e38c65d28379-3
00:24:46.717 --> 00:24:51.719
specific projects or specific capability
gaps that they're looking to fill.

9cac3d93-15e3-4467-85bb-ae3a7dabc51d-0
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.812
So these are really gonna be your best
resource to find those types of

9cac3d93-15e3-4467-85bb-ae3a7dabc51d-1
00:24:54.812 --> 00:24:55.320
opportunities.

b302d643-2232-4c65-b871-be2e4d32a987-0
00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:04.504
Next slide, for licensing,
there's a couple resources you can use,

b302d643-2232-4c65-b871-be2e4d32a987-1
00:25:04.504 --> 00:25:05.320
Barry.

1f59b8aa-7ce8-4042-8b7e-2afb08e80afe-0
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.882
In the next portion,
we'll talk about the Medical Tech

1f59b8aa-7ce8-4042-8b7e-2afb08e80afe-1
00:25:09.882 --> 00:25:13.431
Transfer group supporting DHA,
their website,

1f59b8aa-7ce8-4042-8b7e-2afb08e80afe-2
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:19.062
which has a great repository of Army
Medical or DHA specific IP on their

1f59b8aa-7ce8-4042-8b7e-2afb08e80afe-3
00:25:19.062 --> 00:25:19.680
website.

31564a33-a193-4ba8-9558-d6d08b6fce80-0
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.645
But I'd like to present another resource
that you can use, which is our website,

31564a33-a193-4ba8-9558-d6d08b6fce80-1
00:25:25.645 --> 00:25:27.040
techniquecenter.org.

96402416-3376-44c2-91c7-cc9f3c8aafab-0
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:27.720
Next slide.

33e194b9-5124-4be8-918a-3df5c9b317a3-0
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.800
So here's our homepage and our website.

52f37ce3-8ca0-4451-890c-6351af3e3841-0
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:39.893
One of our duties as a partnership
intermediary is to maintain a catalog of

52f37ce3-8ca0-4451-890c-6351af3e3841-1
00:25:39.893 --> 00:25:43.760
all DoD and VAIP that's been published.

23df1e7b-0656-4898-857c-92905b6cd38c-0
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:53.006
So it's close to 7000 patents that we
maintain on our website and we have a

23df1e7b-0656-4898-857c-92905b6cd38c-1
00:25:53.006 --> 00:25:55.440
searchable database.

a69cdf1e-9876-42d5-848d-31c8d4e00c84-0
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.283
If you go to our web page,
this is kind of the first thing you'll

a69cdf1e-9876-42d5-848d-31c8d4e00c84-1
00:25:59.283 --> 00:25:59.480
see.

84ecf901-9023-4b87-889b-9103ec3c39d8-0
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.840
You can do a high level search.

f68808fd-eeaa-4e95-af32-01f8b78f4d48-0
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.998
But if you go to the next slide,
we also have a number of filters that you

f68808fd-eeaa-4e95-af32-01f8b78f4d48-1
00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:07.640
can use to help refine this.

04b95470-1895-441a-b3f6-027555252dd6-0
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.160
So if you look on the left,
you can filter by technology area.

835d12c8-f533-401c-a52b-3a98c9b8ae58-0
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.880
You can also highlight feature
technologies.

60b9c2a0-d8dd-4333-831e-82774729e984-0
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.187
What this generally means is these are
technologies that we've identified as

60b9c2a0-d8dd-4333-831e-82774729e984-1
00:26:19.187 --> 00:26:22.289
being of high potential commercial
interest,

60b9c2a0-d8dd-4333-831e-82774729e984-2
00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:27.941
very ready for licensing and we actually
prepare all of these technologies have a

60b9c2a0-d8dd-4333-831e-82774729e984-3
00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:32.560
essentially just the abstract from the
patent post on our website.

2861ef61-87c2-43dc-8317-c63843b32d09-0
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.409
But if we identify it as a priority or
feature technology,

2861ef61-87c2-43dc-8317-c63843b32d09-1
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:40.793
we'll also prepare a non confidential
summary essentially like a marketing

2861ef61-87c2-43dc-8317-c63843b32d09-2
00:26:40.793 --> 00:26:41.320
abstract.

e6da2d08-2e54-46e4-8871-4a64479c19f8-0
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.680
These also have links to publications,
other related patents.

a49cf14b-9650-4373-b086-564c815be12b-0
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.922
So the kind of featured IP has maybe a
bit more information to provide some

a49cf14b-9650-4373-b086-564c815be12b-1
00:26:51.922 --> 00:26:53.440
additional background.

ad1c7127-2f7c-4b1f-a4c5-36d07aaa9c5b-0
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.160
You can also filter by technologies that
have express licensing available.

96de76ff-6695-48d9-80b1-7376785e63bb-0
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:04.052
And this is essentially predetermined
licensing fees that have been set by the

96de76ff-6695-48d9-80b1-7376785e63bb-1
00:27:04.052 --> 00:27:08.527
laboratory and they're usually pretty
reasonable, you know,

96de76ff-6695-48d9-80b1-7376785e63bb-2
00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:12.480
one or $2000 upfront and a low single
digit royalty.

bcb42eb7-439c-4a93-8843-c4fd784decfe-0
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.103
So that can express license technologies
can really expedite the process and you

bcb42eb7-439c-4a93-8843-c4fd784decfe-1
00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:21.498
can also in that search by technologies,
you can search by you know keyword,

bcb42eb7-439c-4a93-8843-c4fd784decfe-2
00:27:21.498 --> 00:27:23.040
area of interest, etcetera.

028d5b43-4023-4469-a7f7-357b5b7616c0-0
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:23.720
Next slide.

d7846fa1-80fc-4396-8a1e-61b509748d69-0
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.680
So here for example,
we've filtered to medical technologies

d7846fa1-80fc-4396-8a1e-61b509748d69-1
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:35.047
that have that are featured so that have
a little bit more of a write up and we've

d7846fa1-80fc-4396-8a1e-61b509748d69-2
00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:37.440
included the search term for vaccine.

f87bdbe7-678c-4d1b-97f8-0eba0fc596cc-0
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.992
Let's say you're a vaccine interested
company and let's take a closer look at

f87bdbe7-678c-4d1b-97f8-0eba0fc596cc-1
00:27:41.992 --> 00:27:44.560
this first technology related to
antivirus.

f48c92c8-4b85-45e9-8d92-05ac8abaec06-0
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.360
Next slide.

542d98d3-6783-40f2-91df-ff684eb8fc98-0
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.480
So here's what the kind of the featured
technology breakdown looks like.

c49c9772-56e5-4967-89d4-3750d377fccb-0
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.265
It has a high level executive summary of
the technology may be a relevant picture,

c49c9772-56e5-4967-89d4-3750d377fccb-1
00:27:57.265 --> 00:28:01.554
some bullet point benefits specifically,
you know what are advantages over the

c49c9772-56e5-4967-89d4-3750d377fccb-2
00:28:01.554 --> 00:28:03.400
state-of-the-art over competitors.

1e4f16df-e701-44ab-bc0c-cb7852a6faf5-0
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.320
The opportunity will kind of highlights,
is this an opportunity for collaboration?

73585949-1d43-4470-b4b3-8dd9aa2a76ed-0
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.714
Is this a technology that's actually
ready for licensing might speak to the

73585949-1d43-4470-b4b3-8dd9aa2a76ed-1
00:28:12.714 --> 00:28:13.920
technology readiness level.

375b0220-d734-40d3-9eda-4b923a77badf-0
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.552
And then if if there's associated
scholarly articles or news articles,

375b0220-d734-40d3-9eda-4b923a77badf-1
00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:22.360
we'll link those here.

87a1ea35-d99b-448e-a5d9-fb109cf5b9f3-0
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.040
And then we also have a link to all the
associated patents.

b19fb750-eb4d-4fc9-9bbe-007cd3ba15f8-0
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.694
So really a kind of a one stop shop for
this piece of IP really centralizes all

b19fb750-eb4d-4fc9-9bbe-007cd3ba15f8-1
00:28:29.694 --> 00:28:30.800
of the information.

17b2b87d-7bfa-402e-86c2-97d860d109d3-0
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.443
You don't have to, you know,
go to Google patents and then track down

17b2b87d-7bfa-402e-86c2-97d860d109d3-1
00:28:34.443 --> 00:28:35.120
publications.

60cdbebb-d1c2-4f86-a4b6-77e08813c075-0
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.840
It's all contained right here.

59974a34-e31c-49b7-9762-b87f0b18a54d-0
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.560
Next slide.

855b2c02-4faa-4e19-b157-c011b9c967db-0
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.608
So if you click on that,
speak with an expert,

855b2c02-4faa-4e19-b157-c011b9c967db-1
00:28:41.608 --> 00:28:46.600
it'll it'll pull up this survey to input
some information about your company,

855b2c02-4faa-4e19-b157-c011b9c967db-2
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.720
kind of identify your areas of interest
in terms of technology domains and your

855b2c02-4faa-4e19-b157-c011b9c967db-3
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.000
contact information.

65381621-f837-425f-9b77-c0bf852d8a05-0
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.000
And there's also this check box at the
bottom that I encourage you to click.

2891b3a0-21d8-43b1-a67c-46bff0f8c6ff-0
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.495
This subscribes you to our newsletter,
The Pulse and this will highlight new

2891b3a0-21d8-43b1-a67c-46bff0f8c6ff-1
00:29:02.495 --> 00:29:07.777
technology opportunities in the areas
that you identified and we'll send them

00:29:07.777 --> 00:29:09.200
to you automatically.

161f989a-8a90-435a-b7da-a25719f2c8d5-0
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.066
As I said,
one of our roles as a partnership in new

161f989a-8a90-435a-b7da-a25719f2c8d5-1
00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:17.680
area is to constantly evaluate new DoD
and VAIP as it gets published.

185302a7-970f-43f7-bd56-a5f6fef3fc41-0
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.110
And so the kind of the fastest way to
learn about those opportunities is to

185302a7-970f-43f7-bd56-a5f6fef3fc41-1
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.640
subscribe to our newsletter.

e53c3f02-d392-434b-b17a-72c713dec736-0
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.240
Next slide and here's here's what that
looks like.

208ff38b-9a70-403b-ba10-8b29367de4fd-0
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.792
This is one we recently put out for our
World Health Day related to maternal and

208ff38b-9a70-403b-ba10-8b29367de4fd-1
00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:36.908
neonatal healthcare,
which you probably wouldn't normally

208ff38b-9a70-403b-ba10-8b29367de4fd-2
00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:41.367
think of as a priority area for the DoD,
but there actually is a good amount of IP

208ff38b-9a70-403b-ba10-8b29367de4fd-3
00:29:41.367 --> 00:29:42.120
in this space.

5e1b00e6-7983-41e6-aab6-8cc3f65938b8-0
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.420
And so subscribing to our newsletter
would be a great way to to kind of learn

5e1b00e6-7983-41e6-aab6-8cc3f65938b8-1
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.520
about those opportunities.

eb94a7b6-e6c3-4176-be24-e5301db022eb-0
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.896
Next slide,
a couple other things that we have on our

eb94a7b6-e6c3-4176-be24-e5301db022eb-1
00:29:50.896 --> 00:29:51.480
website.

39100070-d772-4759-b750-d72a337d6d88-0
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.651
We'll post news articles,
essentially success stories,

39100070-d772-4759-b750-d72a337d6d88-1
00:29:55.651 --> 00:30:00.980
so you can see how other companies have
successfully leveraged DODIP to, you know,

39100070-d772-4759-b750-d72a337d6d88-2
00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.640
fulfill capability gaps or bring products
to the market.

0254b11f-a531-465a-a571-a624a1d76a29-0
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.896
And we also have some business focus
articles that might have, you know,

0254b11f-a531-465a-a571-a624a1d76a29-1
00:30:08.896 --> 00:30:10.600
advice about working with the DoD.

2bcb864b-e963-46eb-97ea-ebc9237cfb11-0
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.661
And I mentioned the newsletter on the
previous slide, But if you're, you know,

2bcb864b-e963-46eb-97ea-ebc9237cfb11-1
00:30:15.661 --> 00:30:19.373
a bit wary about cluttering up your inbox,
we also have an A LinkedIn page where

2bcb864b-e963-46eb-97ea-ebc9237cfb11-2
00:30:19.373 --> 00:30:22.720
we'll post a lot of our news article
articles and technology spotlights.

ba16f064-4b2a-48e4-ae33-54bd393f7e3d-0
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.061
So you can also just follow us on
LinkedIn if if the newsletter is,

ba16f064-4b2a-48e4-ae33-54bd393f7e3d-1
00:30:27.061 --> 00:30:29.040
you know, maybe a bit too much.

c7d439b3-8a54-4096-9f84-5761d776b435-0
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.160
Next slide.

4f81bb78-840c-499f-beaf-13ff5da1aa71-0
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:38.141
So I really just want to kind of the main
take away I want from my portion is if

4f81bb78-840c-499f-beaf-13ff5da1aa71-1
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:43.011
you're interested in DoD IP,
recommend visiting our website at

4f81bb78-840c-499f-beaf-13ff5da1aa71-2
00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:44.480
techlinkcenter.org.

17420310-1d9d-4a28-ae49-519ba1f1a30a-0
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.600
But we're also all technology managers
are resource for you.

6e6adc23-b115-4653-847f-60ee33a9ea56-0
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.724
And so let's say you're not,
you maybe don't have time to do an in

6e6adc23-b115-4653-847f-60ee33a9ea56-1
00:30:52.724 --> 00:30:55.987
depth search of our website or, you know,
all DODIP,

6e6adc23-b115-4653-847f-60ee33a9ea56-2
00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:58.942
but you are interested in working with
the DoD,

6e6adc23-b115-4653-847f-60ee33a9ea56-3
00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:02.760
you want to hear more about potential
opportunities to do so.

82946c21-5f58-46e6-91f0-86656ca1c0ca-0
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.455
Just reaching out to our office,
either to me,

82946c21-5f58-46e6-91f0-86656ca1c0ca-1
00:31:06.455 --> 00:31:10.160
my emails right there or coming in
through our web page.

0c11c0c6-d032-418f-9595-8e08ed072a61-0
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.065
Our,
our contact field has some of our

0c11c0c6-d032-418f-9595-8e08ed072a61-1
00:31:13.065 --> 00:31:13.800
information.

c104ee59-04a3-4f65-9b08-615782f38a90-0
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.065
Just just reach out to us and and we can
do a lot of the like work to,

c104ee59-04a3-4f65-9b08-615782f38a90-1
00:31:18.065 --> 00:31:21.040
to try and identify those technologies of
interest for you as well.

bac971c5-0c04-4158-9a0b-a83ee3c62476-0
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.040
So next slide, I think is just Yep.

904f58ba-1f92-48fb-9b17-5b5c0029bb0f-0
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.360
So, so that's it for me.

59eea13b-efa4-43b9-890d-f4308730c50f-0
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.600
Thanks for the opportunity.

21741f38-83bc-4ad5-b566-4da2d325c025-0
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.440
And I think Barry is up.

7a02e5f5-e487-4f13-a108-421c84f0d939-0
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.080
Barry Datloff is up next.

2b1d9050-a84e-4f9e-bc10-f15799db97fe-0
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.640
Thank you so much.

4ae26651-df35-4d79-ad6e-8c448ed49e6b-0
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.040
Thank you so much, Malcolm.

31f6da53-084a-47ea-b105-36c66759c87f-0
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.371
Today,
I'd like to talk about licensing the

31f6da53-084a-47ea-b105-36c66759c87f-1
00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:43.040
intellectual property of DHA.

3702c765-c813-48b5-9e59-8af1a835c8fa-0
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.564
I'm Barry Detloff,
the Chief of Business Development and

3702c765-c813-48b5-9e59-8af1a835c8fa-1
00:31:46.564 --> 00:31:47.640
Commercialization.

6b671744-f7da-471b-a05b-78f013bd9bff-0
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.160
Next slide, usual disclaimer.

075e111e-2921-4fa3-b005-2f5953562ebd-0
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.240
Next slide.

3678895b-61e4-494d-9abb-8567cc77143b-0
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:53.840
All right.

c4abfee6-d704-47d0-87cf-d978062cbdb2-0
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.480
Everybody knows DHA does healthcare.

0e3e1d62-c717-4a02-81ed-c03b63449216-0
00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.280
A lot of folks are unaware of the
specific areas.

94a410ab-3199-4df1-ba77-0e9b297bdb8d-0
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.400
There was a slide previously with a huge
number of them.

daaffc11-b060-43ca-a18a-f9c21b3c3dd6-0
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.120
We like to keep it simple.

c7e0538e-8393-47ff-bb9d-fe2bef2c5987-0
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.920
Vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics,
devices and medical IT.

a998c079-a4a4-427f-aba0-9f52277c9cee-0
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.320
There's plenty more where that came from,
but I'll talk about a few next slide.

0944fc4f-7b5b-46b2-a259-964f738d7755-0
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.041
So military operational medicine is
really our bread and butter,

0944fc4f-7b5b-46b2-a259-964f738d7755-1
00:32:22.041 --> 00:32:27.703
especially down in San Antonio,
Combat casualty care with ISR and Bamsey

0944fc4f-7b5b-46b2-a259-964f738d7755-2
00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:31.581
and the 59th,
we do a lot of blood resuscitation,

0944fc4f-7b5b-46b2-a259-964f738d7755-3
00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:32.280
etcetera.

96deb26b-fc05-45ca-a1f9-9548fad7ae35-0
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.700
And up at Fort Dietrich and at Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research,

96deb26b-fc05-45ca-a1f9-9548fad7ae35-1
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.680
a lot of infectious disease.

ea751335-e713-4904-ae26-75484487151a-0
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.097
Easiest way sometimes to find what you're
looking for is Medline, believe it or not,

ea751335-e713-4904-ae26-75484487151a-1
00:32:45.097 --> 00:32:48.107
search for Army, Navy,
Air Force and the words that you're

ea751335-e713-4904-ae26-75484487151a-2
00:32:48.107 --> 00:32:48.720
looking for.

bc38bef9-871e-408b-8850-c48e150f87b6-0
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.200
Next slide, please.

a4471da5-a094-4329-bc98-cd03c5960e09-0
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.093
So we have a phrase called assistive
technology transfer,

a4471da5-a094-4329-bc98-cd03c5960e09-1
00:32:55.093 --> 00:32:57.400
because it's not a linear process.

ae38989a-63d9-42cc-8373-078b3a68cbbe-0
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.361
People come in to DHA at different times
of development,

ae38989a-63d9-42cc-8373-078b3a68cbbe-1
00:33:01.361 --> 00:33:06.226
whether they're looking for a creative
partner, funding from the DoD,

ae38989a-63d9-42cc-8373-078b3a68cbbe-2
00:33:06.226 --> 00:33:10.049
need help with a prototype or testing it
in the field,

ae38989a-63d9-42cc-8373-078b3a68cbbe-3
00:33:10.049 --> 00:33:15.261
or actually just need some clinical
regulatory guidance for something that

ae38989a-63d9-42cc-8373-078b3a68cbbe-4
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:18.320
will be worn by or used by the war
fighter.

4e0d00a3-fd64-4a82-94cd-358f4b62d455-0
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.293
As always,
intellectual property is the basis for

4e0d00a3-fd64-4a82-94cd-358f4b62d455-1
00:33:22.293 --> 00:33:22.920
licensing.

b956cc5b-5dc0-4855-b8bc-8d75398b38f6-0
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.506
And I'll talk in a little bit about the
expansion that's been occurring slowly

b956cc5b-5dc0-4855-b8bc-8d75398b38f6-1
00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:33.240
but surely for not just patents,
but copyrights, trademarks, etcetera.

1c1b71d2-08f8-49d5-b193-4ece477dfb26-0
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:39.800
But the goal of assist of T2 is singular
military products.

6024812a-2501-4dd8-b58a-781922682973-0
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.600
If we have civilian sales, all the better.

4187cb60-ebba-4517-8715-380eeba9726a-0
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:48.280
The price the military pays goes down and
the company has sustainability.

2982e461-0018-4a32-9912-580a445078cf-0
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.202
We need to get these products not just
invented and researched,

2982e461-0018-4a32-9912-580a445078cf-1
00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:58.705
we need to get them purchased so the war
fighter has them available to mitigate

2982e461-0018-4a32-9912-580a445078cf-2
00:33:58.705 --> 00:33:59.600
any problems.

34ccf74f-22e5-46e2-a6f8-0f4e59ff7dae-0
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.320
Next slide.

6911fd00-9971-4e86-9277-7a5b017b94d1-0
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.280
So I am a flow diagrammer by avocation.

df522da5-018b-4b05-afa8-072b7c6eb963-0
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.160
What can I tell you?

021e648b-579f-4cdb-83e9-ce23bfa24b80-0
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.680
Programmers never can get away from flow.

b603a2e7-4e73-4f9e-af66-cd81f18bf957-0
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.320
They're usually three things that you're
looking for when you knock on our door.

3f12f6a5-bdaa-4a40-b9e3-259d76b05c78-0
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.810
If indeed you're a company or
collaborating,

3f12f6a5-bdaa-4a40-b9e3-259d76b05c78-1
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.320
not-for-profit or universities,
you need money.

59e7f0c9-67f0-42dd-bde6-cc0dcbbe78ae-0
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.360
You want to collaborate with us or you're
actually ready to sell your product.

f58be9de-dc81-431e-b9ac-e64a95337ef7-0
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.520
And getting to the right folk is your
challenge as well as mine.

a8f0b683-4a61-4b38-bdf5-f9691e341cf2-0
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.690
We get a lot of phone calls,
a lot of emails from companies saying,

a8f0b683-4a61-4b38-bdf5-f9691e341cf2-1
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.560
hey, I got this, are you interested?

4a48e744-a1de-4223-8175-d2ccb88d7f64-0
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.200
So this sort of allows us to divvy it up
into three different groups.

8b355dc9-9312-4288-9558-332c1b20a787-0
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.803
There are always new and old ones,
no longer with money,

8b355dc9-9312-4288-9558-332c1b20a787-1
00:34:46.803 --> 00:34:49.680
sources of funding for research.

8b48a396-ca80-4351-b61f-63175126fd73-0
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.920
There's an entire sheet that we keep,
we hope up to date.

1073de66-dcf4-4571-8b2f-f93dfd6f9b27-0
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.800
If you have new ones, add to it for me.

b8f631fc-0ff6-4065-bba0-04913d864bb9-0
00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.861
But we really specialize in collaborating
through our DHA labs and our MTFS for

b8f631fc-0ff6-4065-bba0-04913d864bb9-1
00:35:02.861 --> 00:35:06.570
everything from clinical trials to basic
R&amp;

b8f631fc-0ff6-4065-bba0-04913d864bb9-2
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:13.061
D on some of the pathogens and or medical
conditions that we're charged with on the

b8f631fc-0ff6-4065-bba0-04913d864bb9-3
00:35:13.061 --> 00:35:19.166
right is actually the hardest thing for
us folks in the labs to garner all the

b8f631fc-0ff6-4065-bba0-04913d864bb9-4
00:35:19.166 --> 00:35:20.480
resources around.

8407170e-cf21-4252-b6c9-59e394831ab2-0
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.240
And that is how do you sell back to DHA.

87074aa1-6ac0-419e-b8de-54f1dbef47bd-0
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.408
The sooner the company can sell,
the more sustainable that product is in

87074aa1-6ac0-419e-b8de-54f1dbef47bd-1
00:35:28.408 --> 00:35:29.480
the marketplace.

dfbb6401-2683-4c74-800e-30f882d5c6ff-0
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.040
And we'd like to be the first purchaser,
can't guarantee that we will be.

d05cee8d-ade1-496a-9c3c-8ece6d23e8c8-0
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.960
And when we do R&amp;D with a company,
we can't even guarantee that we'll buy it.

53bc2aea-4a97-4a55-9399-800e034e0d65-0
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.800
So it's still got to be best of breed and
priced reasonably.

21ed03b0-6556-4272-a722-c4a4362da4a0-0
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:50.131
But our DHA vendor days up at for
Dietrich virtual and in person our MHSRS

21ed03b0-6556-4272-a722-c4a4362da4a0-1
00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:56.607
conference really important places to be
to get the SMEs gathered together who are

21ed03b0-6556-4272-a722-c4a4362da4a0-2
00:35:56.607 --> 00:36:02.146
going to support getting this either a
direct commercial off the shelf

21ed03b0-6556-4272-a722-c4a4362da4a0-3
00:36:02.146 --> 00:36:07.919
acquisition or into the DLA warehouse
with the national stock number NSN.

b5c46481-9fad-4025-b993-dd360dc7d746-0
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.960
So this is our lay of the land.

3187d6cb-4471-4ef0-ab14-efaa6497bc92-0
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.080
We hope it helps.

b9f480c8-f969-49e7-9328-c9a332cbf955-0
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.811
Next slide,
we work with a lot of third parties and

b9f480c8-f969-49e7-9328-c9a332cbf955-1
00:36:16.811 --> 00:36:21.600
there's Techlink famous as one of our
outstanding PS.

e5c5b5a7-21cb-4c03-9f3d-f481a57186f0-0
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:29.180
You can see that it does literally take a
village and everybody has different part

e5c5b5a7-21cb-4c03-9f3d-f481a57186f0-1
00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.480
in that process.

f0b8e64e-2c81-4c0f-b7a9-57f9c76453da-0
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.025
We don't work with everybody
simultaneously on one project,

f0b8e64e-2c81-4c0f-b7a9-57f9c76453da-1
00:36:35.025 --> 00:36:38.510
but sometimes there are folks out there
in DoD land,

f0b8e64e-2c81-4c0f-b7a9-57f9c76453da-2
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:43.901
elsewhere in the government that we can
bring into the partnership with a company

f0b8e64e-2c81-4c0f-b7a9-57f9c76453da-3
00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.480
that knocks on our door.

4dea2503-1c83-408b-b482-152c905f0a0d-0
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:51.520
And I'll leave it to Malcolm to define
every single one of these acronyms.

93a99052-bac8-4fad-8655-e2f6ca963fc2-0
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.640
Actually, Scott needs to be able to.

30617d3f-d143-4ec6-a6c3-5186e7cbd64e-0
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.200
We'll have a contest next time I see that.

b7180b3a-1997-42ed-8a40-6429ccbbb797-0
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:56.720
Thumbs up.

7ac4f812-f394-43e9-9c19-bfd49639eee8-0
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.800
Next slide, please.

bd8053db-2099-44fc-afa3-6e837fd68c7c-0
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.360
So we don't call it the Valley of Death,
we call it the Bridge of Hope.

d281e250-95a7-472e-81bf-80f4dec4b228-0
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.763
And our goal along with our friends at
Techlink,

d281e250-95a7-472e-81bf-80f4dec4b228-1
00:37:09.763 --> 00:37:17.668
at Velocity and all the funding kind of
vehicles is to get companies off of their

d281e250-95a7-472e-81bf-80f4dec4b228-2
00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:24.320
sort of traditional bleeding red ink into
going green at some point.

c9a3dcdd-cd80-4915-acb1-0fd5cf85dfe6-0
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.360
And that happens at different stages for
medical devices then, for instance,

c9a3dcdd-cd80-4915-acb1-0fd5cf85dfe6-1
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.880
therapeutics or vaccines.

07542194-45ac-4ef9-8e63-4de5c7e3b875-0
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.693
But this bridge of hope really
encompasses the understanding on the part

07542194-45ac-4ef9-8e63-4de5c7e3b875-1
00:37:36.693 --> 00:37:41.880
of startup companies of how much is
available at each of these stages.

c6296264-f418-44d5-aedb-a81ccad8c666-0
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.975
And of course,
this varies based on who's talking to you,

c6296264-f418-44d5-aedb-a81ccad8c666-1
00:37:45.975 --> 00:37:51.554
how much they actually have in the bank
versus they'd like to have in the bank

c6296264-f418-44d5-aedb-a81ccad8c666-2
00:37:51.554 --> 00:37:53.320
and due diligence as Ken.

b3f46e63-ce8c-4f57-8348-2eb1cbc37a55-0
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.160
Next slide.

6e0176e3-d483-4c5e-86f5-fa1624a34086-0
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.000
Here's the federal funding list I was
noting before.

9c83f747-ff94-4204-ac85-243a226fb04a-0
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.200
I believe empty is swinging in the breeze
at the moment.

24549091-d801-4882-a423-ed474689f9f4-0
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.480
So I don't think they're currently
funding anything.

79fe4ffc-a804-4d44-b681-8669d42e421c-0
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.280
We'd like to have a few more.

fae07e89-27c7-48bb-af43-94ce99455397-0
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.272
If any of you on the call are venture
capitalists and would like to start ADOD

fae07e89-27c7-48bb-af43-94ce99455397-1
00:38:13.272 --> 00:38:15.800
Biomedical Venture Fund, give me a call.

e9098029-88d4-4469-9972-89edb5d9b954-0
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.200
Next slide, previously shown next slide.

e91a018f-2080-48ea-9918-cc3e00c65c65-0
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.400
So what's a license?

fc2c3db6-9f52-42dc-bc3c-32875be42644-0
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.896
Well,
it's not an FDA license that we're

fc2c3db6-9f52-42dc-bc3c-32875be42644-1
00:38:27.896 --> 00:38:28.960
talking about here.

dfd99abb-a1bd-4dc8-9f50-c2babf1182d9-0
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.378
We're talking about how to get the right
to use the patents, copyrights,

dfd99abb-a1bd-4dc8-9f50-c2babf1182d9-1
00:38:33.378 --> 00:38:35.920
trademarks, the traditional tech transfer.

49fe0433-a95f-4360-9fdb-d4f0f747102b-0
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.864
But our materials are know how,
even our trade secrets,

49fe0433-a95f-4360-9fdb-d4f0f747102b-1
00:38:40.864 --> 00:38:44.320
even though Army hates the word,
Navy loves the word.

a2273f3c-0fb7-4659-838e-29a3abc8cbb9-0
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.872
All of that stuff is what we call other
intellectual property and companies can

a2273f3c-0fb7-4659-838e-29a3abc8cbb9-1
00:38:49.872 --> 00:38:54.120
come to us and say, hey,
I'd like to evaluate what you have there.

10caffc4-90e6-429b-b1e2-dab988e753e1-0
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.800
It may be for six months that we just
need to kick the tires.

8d04de8a-1f19-488d-b425-3314859d78a7-0
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.080
It may be that you're locked and loaded,
ready to take a patent license agreement.

2bac145f-c0e7-4902-86e2-9281577166a1-0
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.520
You're going to do a round of financing.

15d02c6b-e769-4a4a-9d6a-cb6e51ad8422-0
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.800
Having it in your portfolio is a good
idea before the investors give you money.

c0b2d2f4-9621-4294-945d-156a90b38b30-0
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.061
But we also do software licensing,
which doesn't even require there to be a

c0b2d2f4-9621-4294-945d-156a90b38b30-1
00:39:17.061 --> 00:39:17.480
patent.

c83c372b-8f66-4895-b41b-3fec1a517ad8-0
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.160
It's under what we call 801.

a26915a9-1b17-4351-9b64-d44e03c4d23b-0
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.998
Software licensing materials are,
you might say a dime a dozen,

a26915a9-1b17-4351-9b64-d44e03c4d23b-1
00:39:23.998 --> 00:39:30.121
but you'd be amazed at how many of the
pathogens frozen in our labs are still of

a26915a9-1b17-4351-9b64-d44e03c4d23b-2
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:35.564
great value, if not ten years,
50 years or 100 years after they've been

a26915a9-1b17-4351-9b64-d44e03c4d23b-3
00:39:35.564 --> 00:39:36.320
collected.

bdbe370f-ae6a-48ea-8575-76fcbf634cea-0
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.360
Next slide.

79f155ac-ff81-4944-88d5-06eec4550063-0
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.880
So what's a typical license look like?

0a5b82d0-9d45-49e2-8406-75be1b536870-0
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.938
And I appreciate Patty having asked this
question because as always,

0a5b82d0-9d45-49e2-8406-75be1b536870-1
00:39:45.938 --> 00:39:48.880
people want to know how fast can I get a
license?

4ee88933-74f0-40ec-937a-a425e8dd4263-0
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.800
And I don't want to pay a lot for this
muffler.

cfa92b73-7a5b-4015-8adb-f2a6882f7ebf-0
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.520
I mean, license, you know what I mean?

fa4ca034-d16a-4fe1-a056-9e923f91d752-0
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.960
So typical deals we wish we could do.

c76cfc97-c5e7-4bdd-aab5-331daa7ab5f0-0
00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.360
Express licensing for everything we can't.

3b6911a3-123a-4ea7-b54c-68e384a56907-0
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.440
A vaccine or a cure for COVID versus a
medical device to keep my snoring down.

9ef1b857-9fa1-4d63-a41d-ddd778378557-0
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.960
They've got to be priced differently,
timed differently, etcetera.

67777ffb-5d8c-43bf-8baf-9dc74c2d0703-0
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.238
We ask companies to give an upfront
license fee as part of our due diligence

67777ffb-5d8c-43bf-8baf-9dc74c2d0703-1
00:40:15.238 --> 00:40:19.857
that they actually have a bank account
because we need to be able to access

67777ffb-5d8c-43bf-8baf-9dc74c2d0703-2
00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:21.680
future funds via such as well.

6b547f9c-3fc0-48f2-96e5-dce993ef2ad5-0
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.395
And the proceeds are shared with the
inventors long before there's a product

6b547f9c-3fc0-48f2-96e5-dce993ef2ad5-1
00:40:26.395 --> 00:40:27.440
in the marketplace.

fc05bd74-6c03-45aa-be20-05726b5eba4d-0
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.551
When inventors decide how how much work
can they afford,

fc05bd74-6c03-45aa-be20-05726b5eba4d-1
00:40:31.551 --> 00:40:35.046
how much time can they afford to work on
something,

fc05bd74-6c03-45aa-be20-05726b5eba4d-2
00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:40.693
It's always a little bit tied to is there
a product at the end of the rainbow or is

fc05bd74-6c03-45aa-be20-05726b5eba4d-3
00:40:40.693 --> 00:40:45.600
the license basically just there for
eternity, which we don't let it be.

b2043bf8-2565-4c45-b131-b34f9105c7f7-0
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.120
We have minimum annual royalties.

03789c4e-eb11-41d0-ab14-ca6d5c7f3c7b-0
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.960
That's to make sure you're still in
business.

e83e9879-1bb1-4245-9db7-2f72793986df-0
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.016
We ask for the patent cost to be
reimbursed over time,

e83e9879-1bb1-4245-9db7-2f72793986df-1
00:40:54.016 --> 00:40:58.240
but the real big chunk comes when there
are products that are sold.

eedd75c7-749b-4298-9db4-9e82127a44e7-0
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:04.689
Royalties on product sales are according
to industry standards with what I'll call

eedd75c7-749b-4298-9db4-9e82127a44e7-1
00:41:04.689 --> 00:41:06.920
government standard discounts.

eef92eb1-2888-480e-942b-eaeac20c577f-0
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.045
In other words,
we're not there to break you over the

eef92eb1-2888-480e-942b-eaeac20c577f-1
00:41:10.045 --> 00:41:10.440
Kohl's.

14dff4c4-c7b4-4287-8a62-57d3aa7ef9cc-0
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.173
We need the product foremost and so our
royalties on product sales are usually

14dff4c4-c7b4-4287-8a62-57d3aa7ef9cc-1
00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:19.997
backloaded a little bit on the time frame
you succeed,

14dff4c4-c7b4-4287-8a62-57d3aa7ef9cc-2
00:41:19.997 --> 00:41:22.640
we expect to succeed in the beginning.

318912cc-91a2-4780-a10d-0431151e2d53-0
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.235
We want your money to be spent on
marketing and even second generation

318912cc-91a2-4780-a10d-0431151e2d53-1
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:29.760
product development milestone payments.

ce69f285-b232-478b-b531-36a85ec7b33a-0
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.703
Like I said, if you just get FDA approval,
your company's worth more,

ce69f285-b232-478b-b531-36a85ec7b33a-1
00:41:34.703 --> 00:41:40.261
you'll pay us back some of the money that
you normally would have paid upfront,

ce69f285-b232-478b-b531-36a85ec7b33a-2
00:41:40.261 --> 00:41:43.040
but we decreased in amount sublicensing.

534ec97e-cbd0-4316-875d-6b4d3071c4a7-0
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.220
Similarly,
most biotechs can't go to the worldwide

534ec97e-cbd0-4316-875d-6b4d3071c4a7-1
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.146
market themselves and sublicense to a
pharma for vaccines and therapeutics and

534ec97e-cbd0-4316-875d-6b4d3071c4a7-2
00:41:51.146 --> 00:41:55.200
frequently that's for money upfront as
well as a royalty stream.

30dfa379-8702-4d72-aa4c-60630a524da7-0
00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.517
We asked for discounts on purchases by
DoD if indeed we're integral to the

30dfa379-8702-4d72-aa4c-60630a524da7-1
00:42:01.517 --> 00:42:06.088
development of the product,
not if it's just sort of a straight up

30dfa379-8702-4d72-aa4c-60630a524da7-2
00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:11.068
intellectual property non financial
compensation may be the provision of

30dfa379-8702-4d72-aa4c-60630a524da7-3
00:42:11.068 --> 00:42:16.458
cleaned up versions of what we send you
if you ultra purify or use subclone or

30dfa379-8702-4d72-aa4c-60630a524da7-4
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:17.960
something of the sort.

cc56a35b-b7d6-4cd0-a91c-8e57e70f578c-0
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.650
DoD has the ability to take equity,
but we only do it in times when the

cc56a35b-b7d6-4cd0-a91c-8e57e70f578c-1
00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:27.760
company requests it for their assistance
in raising capital.

da8cdf01-b6ff-45f1-ad75-93bd6d1483af-0
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.400
We don't do it ourselves for financial
purposes.

29b8ecef-8aff-493c-87ef-f06ba93b499f-0
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.960
We want to make sure that our licensees
are well capitalized.

a882adf5-cd7a-47d2-8879-939bafa9ed0f-0
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:42.664
Timing is really for a license anything
from three weeks I think was our shortest

a882adf5-cd7a-47d2-8879-939bafa9ed0f-1
00:42:42.664 --> 00:42:43.840
to three years.

77e9b5a6-59da-4847-8c43-498c6290a458-0
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.948
And the reason it sometimes does take
three years,

77e9b5a6-59da-4847-8c43-498c6290a458-1
00:42:46.948 --> 00:42:50.560
technology that we have might not
actually be ready for prime time.

e9d1468a-7878-4443-a1d1-620791029dc2-0
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.673
You might do a commercial evaluation
license,

e9d1468a-7878-4443-a1d1-620791029dc2-1
00:42:53.673 --> 00:42:58.642
take a look at it and say it's really not
optimal in our hands and we tell you hey

e9d1468a-7878-4443-a1d1-620791029dc2-2
00:42:58.642 --> 00:42:59.840
we're optimizing it.

96fdf16e-af77-4f75-a3f4-b19d020b410f-0
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.885
So from beginning to end,
it may actually take a period of time to

96fdf16e-af77-4f75-a3f4-b19d020b410f-1
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:08.595
make sure that we can get you what you
actually need to get to the commercial

96fdf16e-af77-4f75-a3f4-b19d020b410f-2
00:43:08.595 --> 00:43:09.320
marketplace.

1f4a5a34-46fc-4455-b71c-4d5a719a452a-0
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.820
Next slide,
our team up at Fort Dietrich as well as

1f4a5a34-46fc-4455-b71c-4d5a719a452a-1
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:20.280
down in San Antonio and actually
worldwide we have licensing professionals.

26cf6d61-afa4-4888-a1d8-dab035a323fa-0
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.132
Next slide,
we put all our contact information here

26cf6d61-afa4-4888-a1d8-dab035a323fa-1
00:43:25.132 --> 00:43:31.640
is for a reason and that's we need you to
call us when you have a question.

80790b39-e134-40cd-8465-162f0c71ba3f-0
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.480
I know it's one of the hardest things to
do to find who you're going to call.

22f70741-dea1-43c5-a6cc-5a4187153664-0
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.520
I'll end at that point and thank you for
your time and attention this afternoon.

d627e0cd-7c7e-412a-baaa-15789b1ec8ad-0
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.760
Thank you, Barry, thank you for that.

5c162488-73b0-4c3a-9a9e-e49d4661220b-0
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.160
These slides will be available.

93d48bbd-28f6-4510-be2b-d197c6d7682b-0
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.414
So all of this contact information,
you don't have your hands after this

93d48bbd-28f6-4510-be2b-d197c6d7682b-1
00:43:52.414 --> 00:43:53.200
participation.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.200
Next up is Greg Sullivan from Tremonti.

2ebcdffc-34ca-4136-bd92-8cedf059ae70-0
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:05.421
What we're introducing is the problem
that we continue to have is matching

2ebcdffc-34ca-4136-bd92-8cedf059ae70-1
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:11.145
almost like a guidance service of
intellectual property to potential

2ebcdffc-34ca-4136-bd92-8cedf059ae70-2
00:44:11.145 --> 00:44:13.800
licenses and in reverse as well.

dfcdb1a2-85e8-4ce3-9974-43d1490a8bef-0
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:20.828
So for a place to identify that there are
consultant services and available to that

dfcdb1a2-85e8-4ce3-9974-43d1490a8bef-1
00:44:20.828 --> 00:44:25.272
our specializes,
we specialize in medical intellectual

dfcdb1a2-85e8-4ce3-9974-43d1490a8bef-2
00:44:25.272 --> 00:44:26.000
problems.

07161e0d-c955-430d-b0fa-7ed9e64c558c-0
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.622
So, you know,
I'm just seeing some questions being

07161e0d-c955-430d-b0fa-7ed9e64c558c-1
00:44:29.622 --> 00:44:30.120
posted.

fe72a75b-cbb5-4725-8b79-e4ebb84aa353-0
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.880
We're wrapping up soon and we'll get to
your questions.

09bd2f7e-fb27-43a7-bb20-4132a7cc038c-0
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:33.600
Thank you.

dc4edea2-7ee4-4ab7-a019-7f3d9425e4c9-0
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.120
So thank you.

f766f781-0046-45c8-8da3-0098327ac849-0
00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.200
I hope you even look great.

750c0fb2-e740-480c-9c3d-d6599b30a02c-0
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:38.920
Thanks.

fa63ca9d-b7db-4bb5-a1f3-dabec48aae71-0
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.400
OK, Julie.

fc08d4bc-2390-4a9a-a15e-f63d1f7a99c2-0
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.200
Yeah.

ff3c7f6e-2898-4918-88a9-0253aaee091b-0
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:41.560
Hi.

fbb34771-904d-42df-a839-f40d96035b49-0
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.560
You take it over.

6e8bf935-0fbc-4e99-b3a7-1e1a5fa66b61-0
00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.160
Yeah.

0f16a289-488d-452f-ab08-359ba30e60fa-0
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.640
My name is Julie Nagle.

da9971e8-8498-4ea9-91c6-2b92df52ea74-0
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.160
I'm with Trevani Consulting and thank you
for having us today.

8a54059e-360a-4d57-8041-93c18ef480dd-0
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.697
And my colleague, you just heard,
Greg Sullivan,

8a54059e-360a-4d57-8041-93c18ef480dd-1
00:44:50.697 --> 00:44:53.080
will be joining me in this presentation
team.

c5cab9dc-1614-4b6e-84c8-f22cde2d8be0-0
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.096
So today we're going to talk about the
many problems that we face in tech

c5cab9dc-1614-4b6e-84c8-f22cde2d8be0-1
00:44:58.096 --> 00:45:02.034
transfer and innovation,
getting those great technologies noticed

c5cab9dc-1614-4b6e-84c8-f22cde2d8be0-2
00:45:02.034 --> 00:45:06.331
and into the hands of the people that
could make them into products and

c5cab9dc-1614-4b6e-84c8-f22cde2d8be0-3
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:08.480
services that change lives everyday.

6ca01833-9e36-4cc0-b60b-12a1fd294deb-0
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.280
Next slide, please.

5b7ea62e-be4d-4bf1-913d-a29f0f2d809f-0
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.040
And here's our disclaimer.

734caf1a-9821-43ab-b939-88a33fc197d2-0
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.920
Next slide, please.

9c7ea212-c05c-4d3b-8a5a-df69b96d5368-0
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.720
So Tremonti's worked across tech transfer
ecosystem for more than two decades.

a815c443-b106-42b8-afd8-39e8bca33966-0
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.960
We just had our 20th anniversary in fact.

a1c5069d-c68a-4525-ac98-d82c4ad236b0-0
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.001
And we support universities, hospitals,
federal labs,

a1c5069d-c68a-4525-ac98-d82c4ad236b0-1
00:45:28.001 --> 00:45:32.564
everyone that's trying to translate their
intellectual property portfolio to the

a1c5069d-c68a-4525-ac98-d82c4ad236b0-2
00:45:32.564 --> 00:45:33.240
marketplace.

08b6b8fe-d212-443d-9f08-828c7a31e309-0
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.400
We're a team of licensing professionals.

edeb9bdc-79a6-4b5b-840c-3f2b996d0a10-0
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:41.158
We have entrepreneurial backgrounds,
IP strategy backgrounds and our work

edeb9bdc-79a6-4b5b-840c-3f2b996d0a10-1
00:45:41.158 --> 00:45:45.360
spans all sectors and we've closed
hundreds of deals.

20d684eb-73ab-4d9f-a641-6016d9310ccc-0
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.642
What we bring is not just experience,
but an understanding of where the pain

20d684eb-73ab-4d9f-a641-6016d9310ccc-1
00:45:50.642 --> 00:45:55.143
points are because we've all been in the
trenches and seen the pain points up

20d684eb-73ab-4d9f-a641-6016d9310ccc-2
00:45:55.143 --> 00:45:56.240
close and personal.

b1c6daaa-1c54-4da9-a249-2d49ba26c2db-0
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.120
Currently have about 250 active clients
worldwide.

9c491829-a30c-44a7-96c5-8d10ccb4277f-0
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:06.840
Next slide.

7430c214-3453-453c-b652-1a73fe235ef0-0
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.480
So the reality of what we're dealing with
is pretty stark.

5e002ba3-78bc-4c3f-919f-f8103dcc27c7-0
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.560
95% of all in disclosed inventions never
get licensed.

8b0f4ae7-21b8-49fa-aa39-e2615f4c789a-0
00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.800
You know,
a lot of them don't get protected either.

b67416a6-23b3-446d-8a1e-f6c512256313-0
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.000
So I'm just a reflection of the science
or the inventor.

448e1659-f15d-469c-83b7-16c36e59739d-0
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.008
It's a result of limited outreach
capacity, some generic messaging,

448e1659-f15d-469c-83b7-16c36e59739d-1
00:46:29.008 --> 00:46:35.122
and really the dawn of AI flooding all of
our inboxes with information and lack of

448e1659-f15d-469c-83b7-16c36e59739d-2
00:46:35.122 --> 00:46:36.080
people power.

9bc5401a-816c-4f24-8491-45402508719f-0
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.786
Tech transfer offices are stretched
pretty thin and a lot of cold marketing

9bc5401a-816c-4f24-8491-45402508719f-1
00:46:40.786 --> 00:46:43.200
techniques are put in place as a result.

f21e9843-0cee-408b-8a84-bc5105cf7634-0
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.320
And they really just a lot of times don't
go anywhere.

4ad2420f-f5b1-4075-8c70-396bd0ff9435-0
00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.860
So those are a lot of problems that we're
up against as we try to translate these

4ad2420f-f5b1-4075-8c70-396bd0ff9435-1
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.680
great technologies to into the right
hands that can work through the

4ad2420f-f5b1-4075-8c70-396bd0ff9435-2
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.120
commercialization process.

6aff9f4d-3643-4ca0-a214-fd2d15d2115f-0
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:02.560
OK.

1b10ed54-de54-48eb-959c-acf6fa91cc65-0
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.720
Technology transfer professionals are
dealing with mounting disclosure volumes

1b10ed54-de54-48eb-959c-acf6fa91cc65-1
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.266
and they don't have the staff or
marketing support to really tailor each

1b10ed54-de54-48eb-959c-acf6fa91cc65-2
00:47:12.266 --> 00:47:17.373
technologies that they see into the hands
of the folks that can do something with

1b10ed54-de54-48eb-959c-acf6fa91cc65-3
00:47:17.373 --> 00:47:17.559
it.

87b4eec8-9603-46c2-8020-d69dd304c67a-0
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:23.160
Our clients tell us a lot of times we're
so busy we're just reacting.

7f9fb7c3-ba89-452a-89c1-625231f4341d-0
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.600
We don't have the ability to strategize.

ab6ceb70-77dd-4826-9ad0-eb50b2368bda-0
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.564
We don't have the bandwidth to pursue
targeted leads and find those leads and

ab6ceb70-77dd-4826-9ad0-eb50b2368bda-1
00:47:30.564 --> 00:47:32.200
tell our story effectively.

f0a63f9e-1865-4f5d-bd71-a246ad2a6868-0
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.880
That's really structural challenges.

dddce40e-3fc2-49ce-a50e-25f22f74cd09-0
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.640
They're not unique to anyone institution.

265e39e0-367d-4003-959e-d6e3ed3e09b8-0
00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.720
We see that across our client base.

90c3e2c5-4d3f-468e-bbd0-cf8157cb5fcb-0
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.400
I I just have one thing to add.

72cc409e-3cd9-4c50-a4e9-36cab6af4050-0
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:49.400
What's interesting about marketing today
versus pre pandemic?

b25110e3-cd25-43a1-8e24-fcbe11aba02e-0
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:57.666
Prior to the pandemic you could reach
your perspective targets via by e-mail

b25110e3-cd25-43a1-8e24-fcbe11aba02e-1
00:47:57.666 --> 00:48:00.840
and potentially even office phone.

39f34034-362d-46e7-b2eb-0fd8f1e7df50-0
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.840
Post pandemic it's nobody answers the
office phone anymore.

05e88923-a359-423a-91cb-1930ad0eebfd-0
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.400
Too many robo calls.

ba959a21-ec1a-41dd-873e-a60eb90a434d-0
00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.040
Same case with e-mail.

7bd51993-9b4b-45a5-9b61-9415bad55391-0
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:21.280
E-mail is now dominated by AI bots that
are flooding the the their e-mail boxes.

48ce2057-4a5c-4e62-9963-85fc101947d1-0
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:27.152
So we've actually kind of reverted in the
marketplace back to traditional marketing

48ce2057-4a5c-4e62-9963-85fc101947d1-1
00:48:27.152 --> 00:48:29.040
and traditional networking.

dd80a290-1315-4751-9722-5a1252149a25-0
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:35.215
Sort of kind of the value of this
particular meeting is to actually meet,

dd80a290-1315-4751-9722-5a1252149a25-1
00:48:35.215 --> 00:48:39.040
go back and meet people and have
relationships.

2ad7f377-6561-433f-a9cb-ad6eb21d1f7c-0
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.791
Our firm is 20 years old in this space,
so we've maintained our relationships

2ad7f377-6561-433f-a9cb-ad6eb21d1f7c-1
00:48:43.791 --> 00:48:44.920
throughout the years.

e2559777-6691-400d-a73f-e458a43f59ed-0
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.360
Oh, next slide.

1559d235-7c2a-4607-a014-4bbb37d87b2e-0
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.480
So, oh, I'm sorry, you were already there.

04cc6b6e-5f8b-45ba-9011-e37725e09494-0
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.560
I apologize.

bd66c7fa-fe75-42cd-b89d-3158244117e5-0
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.360
You'd already switched.

ba5e2802-d026-4523-a155-1c8114d5b651-0
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:55.640
Yeah.

8392c33c-2b93-467a-8376-ce61c8d62fd6-0
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.314
So to move on to external partners,
this is really where working with an

8392c33c-2b93-467a-8376-ce61c8d62fd6-1
00:49:03.314 --> 00:49:07.000
external firm can be helpful and add
value.

db0ea11f-846b-4fa5-8ca1-9ee107ca57d4-0
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.920
We don't replace internal teams,
but we amplify their reach.

2be80010-3700-4ab3-8759-6eb3e3d2e920-0
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:17.840
We bring our network in to find contacts
and target technologies.

11a02cea-30f6-433d-b9c3-c449826571f0-0
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.280
So we bring that marketing horsepower,
objectivity, storytelling ability.

e66cc22e-21f1-441e-bcf4-2a9353271f0f-0
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.719
We know how to communicate with
scientists,

e66cc22e-21f1-441e-bcf4-2a9353271f0f-1
00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:30.600
our scientists and we also speak the
language of the market.

6359e0ae-e3ac-41f5-b6a1-9691adef72cc-0
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.720
So we can help with that business
development bridge that you saw earlier.

eaba9c4f-6696-4008-abd1-9dfe0e3a1865-0
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.640
And we help institutions build meaningful
curated content.

f1a02083-2132-478d-a1d6-8f5232303b02-0
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.620
And we, as Greg said,
we don't send out the cold emails into

f1a02083-2132-478d-a1d6-8f5232303b02-1
00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.160
the void.

6a4fa55b-4a66-477d-a722-7f80b0149195-0
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.635
It's really a person to person networking
and really doing those,

6a4fa55b-4a66-477d-a722-7f80b0149195-1
00:49:48.635 --> 00:49:54.196
finding the you know what curated list of
companies that would be appropriate for

6a4fa55b-4a66-477d-a722-7f80b0149195-2
00:49:54.196 --> 00:49:59.960
that technology and understanding why and
then making contacts with those companies.

059a6598-a0fe-44ce-88df-998444eb0f43-0
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.240
OK, now next slide.

51c86bac-5112-4a30-899e-d0d41932ec36-0
00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.320
So here's our process.

fca529c0-f029-4149-b40b-10d939ce3390-0
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.353
It's structured, but it's adaptable,
begins with understanding the technology

fca529c0-f029-4149-b40b-10d939ce3390-1
00:50:12.353 --> 00:50:14.400
and identifying the real market fit.

21e70ce6-5948-4b53-b9ef-3885523e4069-0
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.280
We build technology marketing materials.

e0fcf5d1-0c68-4ad6-80df-bc4146467ce3-0
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.000
You'll see an example of one that was
created for a client there.

406654bf-9591-43e5-9351-12fcd782b549-0
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.400
And then we really look to see what
companies would we want to send that to.

32caa9e9-3d54-4432-bc8f-92e263afa84f-0
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.662
And we prioritize that based on, you know,
what they've done in the past,

32caa9e9-3d54-4432-bc8f-92e263afa84f-1
00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.800
market research.

b576c7f1-ff22-41a2-8771-1ec3ede674a2-0
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:41.067
And then we do personalized outreach as
Greg mentioned earlier and we track those

b576c7f1-ff22-41a2-8771-1ec3ede674a2-1
00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:47.938
data and we continue to refine and learn
from that over time is we re look for new

b576c7f1-ff22-41a2-8771-1ec3ede674a2-2
00:50:47.938 --> 00:50:52.160
contacts for companies we haven't found
homes for.

6852a494-8d20-4101-ba68-e8a0439e59a4-0
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.552
So this allows us to consistently build
some momentum instead of consistent,

6852a494-8d20-4101-ba68-e8a0439e59a4-1
00:50:56.552 --> 00:51:00.610
instead of consistently going back the
same companies that just aren't ever

6852a494-8d20-4101-ba68-e8a0439e59a4-2
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.640
going to buy early stage technologies.

c641048a-820f-4819-a1a1-dcb2cdf656d5-0
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:06.840
OK.

5ce60e48-c6db-4411-a177-f4b5074e7694-0
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.840
Next slide and why it works.

53524d92-8a24-4a6f-a85e-6ae92841464d-0
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.280
It's focused,
it's driven on networks and conversations.

effc78c4-fad8-4b86-b359-448bf6940435-0
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.720
It's not just promoting technology to the
void.

e845ce99-bf42-4fe0-a89f-2f4f5128d861-0
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.289
We've all,
everybody at Termani's had a lot of

e845ce99-bf42-4fe0-a89f-2f4f5128d861-1
00:51:24.289 --> 00:51:29.200
industry experience and we're able to
tailor the messaging down because of that.

68ade867-c676-4fbd-b209-3117675617db-0
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.520
And follow-ups key.

b0d2c4cf-a5be-4604-a36a-d81a265184bd-0
00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.636
As Greg says,
it's hard to find some people that work

b0d2c4cf-a5be-4604-a36a-d81a265184bd-1
00:51:35.636 --> 00:51:38.866
at home and work remotely and are in the
office sometimes,

b0d2c4cf-a5be-4604-a36a-d81a265184bd-2
00:51:38.866 --> 00:51:40.399
not in the office sometimes.

43f43d9d-4829-4c16-9fce-75959158e48f-0
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:45.586
So persistence and follow up have been
really important as we've gone through

43f43d9d-4829-4c16-9fce-75959158e48f-1
00:51:45.586 --> 00:51:48.360
this change back to more traditional
marketing.

6b527ec2-5e99-46b8-b591-fda19d3490a4-0
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.535
And most deals don't come from a single
touch point where you talk to him once

6b527ec2-5e99-46b8-b591-fda19d3490a4-1
00:51:53.535 --> 00:51:55.080
and it ends with the licensing.

c6e6fb28-765e-4b69-b202-b574a4b41ae9-0
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.880
It's a pretty long conversation.

7f2f78ac-39a3-4e2b-816d-85263a29d2b1-0
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.240
OK.

cbe245e1-12ba-43cf-bad3-b49f7b77064b-0
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.840
So we're getting the right message to the
right audience at the right time.

dfa9fa7d-5d3e-4b52-a9d6-edb027f8a209-0
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.120
So next slide.

619839b2-14eb-446a-82c0-6bccac0098e2-0
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:15.818
So how we can or any consultant can
support you through the marketing process,

619839b2-14eb-446a-82c0-6bccac0098e2-1
00:52:15.818 --> 00:52:18.560
It really spans past outreach.

77ab62ac-bc54-4a0d-a21f-34f66da23390-0
00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.051
We help with identifying targets,
narrowing down those and prioritizing

77ab62ac-bc54-4a0d-a21f-34f66da23390-1
00:52:24.051 --> 00:52:27.955
those targets,
Relationship development that we bring to

77ab62ac-bc54-4a0d-a21f-34f66da23390-2
00:52:27.955 --> 00:52:28.640
the table.

538b86aa-6f30-4d8a-a11b-bbc33acab715-0
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.320
We can look at comparative transactions
in a similar space.

ec724e7a-4a64-4b13-a227-124257dc2ea9-0
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:36.600
You see an example of one of those
reports that we do on the screen.

4a1baca3-15ef-4462-8dde-7c4431c1b4a2-0
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.440
We help with term sheets and developing
those first,

4a1baca3-15ef-4462-8dde-7c4431c1b4a2-1
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.524
those first terms that you put in front
of the partner all the way out to

4a1baca3-15ef-4462-8dde-7c4431c1b4a2-2
00:52:46.524 --> 00:52:50.440
licensing, negotiation,
evaluations of the technologies.

b72231f2-2d5a-4640-9f8b-e8844ba9ad98-0
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.502
We can help through that entire process
or any piece there in that a client might

b72231f2-2d5a-4640-9f8b-e8844ba9ad98-1
00:52:56.502 --> 00:52:57.560
need help with.

0c84004a-0cb7-470c-b63a-3608308dd60b-0
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.680
So we really act as an extension of your
team.

ef2e3b8a-4279-4707-904b-a702e57040e4-0
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.686
You know when your internal capability is
limited or you have tight timelines could

ef2e3b8a-4279-4707-904b-a702e57040e4-1
00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:11.840
help to have another person there running
this with you.

6b78dc73-27b6-4658-9edb-2ea72d420419-0
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.000
Next slide.

78fc5bc3-206c-465e-8df7-2cecfd5f1a59-0
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:23.079
So this is a case study and I, you know,
I could give you more than one of these,

78fc5bc3-206c-465e-8df7-2cecfd5f1a59-1
00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:28.675
but this is a recent one that we have
sometimes technology sent to us saying

78fc5bc3-206c-465e-8df7-2cecfd5f1a59-2
00:53:28.675 --> 00:53:33.400
the inventor just wants you to push this
out here one more time.

8169479b-2629-408b-8d34-cf494b2d05a2-0
00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.640
Let's just see if there's any traction
one more time.

ad8fe6a8-18c2-4faa-a1f6-23b049453d26-0
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.360
We haven't gotten any traction on this
technology and this was one of those.

93cd1c2d-549d-490c-856c-b7640838dfaa-0
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.320
They just wanted one more push before
they closed it.

6ec61282-7d28-4ceb-bf02-797291774cbc-0
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.236
So we looked at their marketing materials
and we're like do you care if we revamp

6ec61282-7d28-4ceb-bf02-797291774cbc-1
00:53:48.236 --> 00:53:48.800
all of those?

a7256936-d345-4de6-940e-7d399983d586-0
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.480
And they said no,
just do what you need to do.

bad603d3-9a8a-4ecf-9971-bf33ce1b097c-0
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.800
We redid the non confidential summary in
a slide deck.

977e3883-ca6d-4cb7-8523-177e4eca7c9a-0
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.702
We researched what companies we should
target and we really narrowed it down to

977e3883-ca6d-4cb7-8523-177e4eca7c9a-1
00:54:01.702 --> 00:54:02.200
about 40.

4e009ebc-fac9-4b02-9d68-eb3ca2729faf-0
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:08.000
There might even have been 35 and
understood why they were on that list.

50a050fa-60ba-433d-a40d-c34580fc57ab-0
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.920
And that led to two industry
conversations.

87ef54e8-27b2-44e8-b3d7-fb0cc818d46e-0
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.945
One of them led to Accreda and some more
sponsored research to further develop

87ef54e8-27b2-44e8-b3d7-fb0cc818d46e-1
00:54:17.945 --> 00:54:21.640
that technology while it was still in the
institution.

8d651152-4b79-4461-92a4-ee5a41170369-0
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.671
We did a comparative transaction report
for them,

8d651152-4b79-4461-92a4-ee5a41170369-1
00:54:24.671 --> 00:54:28.678
so they kind of knew what they were
looking at going into a term sheet and

8d651152-4b79-4461-92a4-ee5a41170369-2
00:54:28.678 --> 00:54:29.480
where to start.

56d90107-78a2-44fe-860c-c3e3ade0da2d-0
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.560
We helped him construct that term sheet
and now they're in licensing negotiations.

a91e1cd9-aac2-43a5-aabf-a19c16a00cd1-0
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.395
So that's a case study of how we came in
and augmented and helped on a technology

a91e1cd9-aac2-43a5-aabf-a19c16a00cd1-1
00:54:40.395 --> 00:54:42.120
that had really been stuck.

de6efdb4-b4da-4f3d-ac9d-30eeeb9528c3-0
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.588
But through our market assessment,
we thought we could probably find it a

de6efdb4-b4da-4f3d-ac9d-30eeeb9528c3-1
00:54:46.588 --> 00:54:50.920
home and we don't really understand why
it was stuck and they weren't moving.

59494783-169e-42e1-8462-dfccd2e5897d-0
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.428
So working together in partnership,
we were able to move that technology to

59494783-169e-42e1-8462-dfccd2e5897d-1
00:54:55.428 --> 00:54:56.520
the licensing stage.

7e7e6382-fe8c-4abf-a254-8c5a280cff5d-0
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.200
OK.

dc629716-e8bf-4724-a2cd-44da1f721811-0
00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.080
Next slide.

e027b07f-0de8-49ab-983d-98f303f8056e-0
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:10.240
So there's a lot of tools that we deploy
to make this happen.

f7a82f1e-a2c6-40de-81d3-a2826067b52e-0
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.400
One is marketing briefs.

4d82c017-73ce-4d4c-a00e-099c7d9746ad-0
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.800
These are one pagers that you've probably
seen as in CDs.

5d651f83-7210-4d17-8f09-078b21386b1c-0
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:20.686
We're moving more to licensing decks too,
so we can show more data,

5d651f83-7210-4d17-8f09-078b21386b1c-1
00:55:20.686 --> 00:55:23.920
especially in therapeutics that's
important.

6430b861-d157-455e-9329-3000824e7a5f-0
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.320
So you know where you are in the
preclinical stage.

78dde686-9851-4ee9-beed-e2740a8f7b68-0
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:35.389
We use it as CRM to really track our
contacts and how they how how it was

78dde686-9851-4ee9-beed-e2740a8f7b68-1
00:55:35.389 --> 00:55:41.449
their uptake to technology or they just
one that never respond and never call

78dde686-9851-4ee9-beed-e2740a8f7b68-2
00:55:41.449 --> 00:55:45.800
back or they have are they really warm to
technologies.

c39f668c-61af-433b-86a9-9746455e41cf-0
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:51.278
And then we can mark in there too who we
know personally through our networks to

c39f668c-61af-433b-86a9-9746455e41cf-1
00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:56.419
be able to get information back on
technologies and that real time industry

c39f668c-61af-433b-86a9-9746455e41cf-2
00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:57.840
feedback is critical.

c6d0c378-5f88-4f91-8613-2e5d7bba9418-0
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.405
So this is an example of a marketing
report that we give at the end of every

c6d0c378-5f88-4f91-8613-2e5d7bba9418-1
00:56:03.405 --> 00:56:04.000
campaign.

8934994d-d2d8-41ff-b168-b7dc210b3d69-0
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.641
So we give a lot of those data and
analytics back to the client so they

8934994d-d2d8-41ff-b168-b7dc210b3d69-1
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:12.960
understand what the markets kind of
saying about their technology.

573a9c0d-9668-4629-8d76-73d7b1e7c5c4-0
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.680
Not always positive,
but not always negative either.

c5ce6b38-7f15-4dbc-8065-d09547e5a5eb-0
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.280
The next slide.

a282fe90-3037-42c2-bcd4-1f849f64dc03-0
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.207
So here's an ideal collaboration model
and you know there's third nuance to

a282fe90-3037-42c2-bcd4-1f849f64dc03-1
00:56:25.207 --> 00:56:25.920
every client.

b5f95931-e438-4421-8cee-5e9623ce4f4f-0
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.720
This is the typical rubric.

c7442755-8a44-4ea1-8b1a-bec30bf6709c-0
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:35.594
The client chooses the technology and the
goals for the technology and we Co

c7442755-8a44-4ea1-8b1a-bec30bf6709c-1
00:56:35.594 --> 00:56:39.000
develop a message and a strategy therein.

38b8cf0f-b360-434c-8f1b-a1514b9be2d2-0
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:45.739
And that curated list that we're going to
target that I've talked about a number of

38b8cf0f-b360-434c-8f1b-a1514b9be2d2-1
00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:49.966
times we are in,
we're in communication with the client

38b8cf0f-b360-434c-8f1b-a1514b9be2d2-2
00:56:49.966 --> 00:56:55.400
about what we're hearing from the market
and providing regular updates.

8c2ea8d5-ec88-4b60-a19f-fa7ba40d7bf7-0
00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.158
And then with a final report with the
analytics you just saw,

8c2ea8d5-ec88-4b60-a19f-fa7ba40d7bf7-1
00:57:00.158 --> 00:57:03.920
that's a process that's scalable across
sectors.

bb18e0ef-df7c-4760-bccd-4c4743f49def-0
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:10.522
And you can have one technology marketing
or you can have 10s of we've had even

bb18e0ef-df7c-4760-bccd-4c4743f49def-1
00:57:10.522 --> 00:57:15.360
more than I think 80's,
the largest I've had from one client.

52694a34-3e58-476a-98c8-187d2516cfcc-0
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.720
So it's very scalable to depending on the
size of your portfolio.

bdf8c1b2-59ac-4a26-bb58-f107cab189ab-0
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.040
OK, next slide.

11232839-369c-48c2-bc2f-04ffb9d37fd5-0
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:34.566
So I want you to take away from this that
using that warm technology approach after

11232839-369c-48c2-bc2f-04ffb9d37fd5-1
00:57:34.566 --> 00:57:40.667
the advent of AI,
after the pandemic has really borne more

11232839-369c-48c2-bc2f-04ffb9d37fd5-2
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:48.525
fruit for us than the cold marketing
techniques that were ramping up during

11232839-369c-48c2-bc2f-04ffb9d37fd5-3
00:57:48.525 --> 00:57:49.559
that time.

8155807a-2874-411d-8c27-e6becdd3089d-0
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.487
With the right partners,
you can really scale and you can get more

8155807a-2874-411d-8c27-e6becdd3089d-1
00:57:55.487 --> 00:57:59.120
of your technologies in front of the
right people for some feedback.

f2b580f6-4c3b-4623-94bc-6972cafe3c67-0
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.400
So you can go back to your inventors and
say this is what the market's saying.

34bad85d-5a6b-4d2b-96b7-d7bfb2e60020-0
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.176
It can help drive their research in a
different way,

34bad85d-5a6b-4d2b-96b7-d7bfb2e60020-1
00:58:06.176 --> 00:58:07.800
can lead to sponsored research.

97751e43-6833-47f8-8a6a-97077ddf5127-0
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.480
There's all different areas that that can
lead to when you develop partnerships

97751e43-6833-47f8-8a6a-97077ddf5127-1
00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:18.544
with companies and those partnerships
that we're finding are taking a more

97751e43-6833-47f8-8a6a-97077ddf5127-2
00:58:18.544 --> 00:58:21.920
personal touch these days and didn't in
the past.

5918e674-cc30-4fa8-9a3f-2c974c556b49-0
00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:26.838
So building that bridge between research
and the corporate community takes

5918e674-cc30-4fa8-9a3f-2c974c556b49-1
00:58:26.838 --> 00:58:30.720
teamwork and is bringing external
partners in helps you do that.

92d97ddb-183f-4ff4-92df-d7663030928e-0
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:37.784
The only thing that I have to add to
Julie's presentation is that our

92d97ddb-183f-4ff4-92df-d7663030928e-1
00:58:37.784 --> 00:58:44.015
objective is to move those relationships
to you so that you have them when we're

92d97ddb-183f-4ff4-92df-d7663030928e-2
00:58:44.015 --> 00:58:44.400
done.

cb6ecb42-5c7a-4ac0-a75b-a499c8c2eeed-0
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.560
We leave you with those market contacts
and those relationships moving forward.

d6da0ca4-50d0-4ca2-93c3-2e7ff0f5e35d-0
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.800
Yeah, thank you.

dceddacb-5174-4413-9dd5-745c21178512-0
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.533
Thank you,
Greg and Julie for that presentation and

dceddacb-5174-4413-9dd5-745c21178512-1
00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.320
for all our presenters here today.

5e0f1839-23e3-4b52-9555-c69d6c4990bb-0
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.439
So at this point,
we have a few minutes that we can take

5e0f1839-23e3-4b52-9555-c69d6c4990bb-1
00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:06.920
some questions and I know that we have
some questions online.

0780b400-8200-4646-be4b-5b0245f157f1-0
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.880
So why don't we take a question online
and then I'll ask the question is.

b224a7ee-ad88-4adb-8097-099d065eca0b-0
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.915
The question is,
can someone clarify when the next

b224a7ee-ad88-4adb-8097-099d065eca0b-1
00:59:21.915 --> 00:59:24.320
upcoming medical vendor gave will be the
event?

748ec2cf-f72a-453c-97fb-b21cdb335a6e-0
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.760
Did you guys hear that question?

5190b315-da42-4a02-9ac4-10ae5325a665-0
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.160
Yeah, this is Barry Detloff.

4d2d7674-2fd0-4314-9d7e-7153a9e9fc62-0
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.000
Steve Burroughs used to handle it for
Medlock up at Fort Detrick.

3ac56c62-059f-4b62-91d4-4725c409f5bc-0
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:46.678
I just emailed him and of course,
he's either taken a Vera visa or another

3ac56c62-059f-4b62-91d4-4725c409f5bc-1
00:59:46.678 --> 00:59:47.120
job.

a6f5f7cd-a8c2-4f13-bdbe-e83f8506da4c-0
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:53.497
So I'll see if I can dig up who at
Medlog's still working there and we'll

a6f5f7cd-a8c2-4f13-bdbe-e83f8506da4c-1
00:59:53.497 --> 00:59:55.480
pass that back through.

3a460b4a-b60a-4a05-8389-3904fe07fc7c-0
00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:02.141
Aim for distribution to the attendees,
unless somebody else knows who's

3a460b4a-b60a-4a05-8389-3904fe07fc7c-1
01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:06.280
responsible for the DHA vendor days
anymore.

71ce3bde-9a49-49de-b5e4-87e7040c9827-0
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.000
Thanks, Barry.

1eea6cc1-ee91-41b6-9c16-7179ba8de1bf-0
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.840
OK, thanks.

2bacd24c-d6d5-4da8-8827-47029fc1488e-0
01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.200
Barry.

f278a100-cfc1-4436-ab19-e407028ab39b-0
01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.520
Is there a question in the group?

c5efbb24-e6db-4d3b-9ace-fd8dc6bf98f0-0
01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.440
You have a question in the room.

4f26a151-78d4-4211-b0c9-19c94f4675f6-0
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.320
Yeah, OK.

09865627-0178-4618-b438-4321ef25e8be-0
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.040
So we'll take the next question online.

91b34346-dea0-44b9-933a-0c64f1ab66e3-0
01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.380
Could you advise whether Techlink,
DHA or Tremont,

91b34346-dea0-44b9-933a-0c64f1ab66e3-1
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.997
he dealt with the IP generated from the
Paralyzed Veterans of America Research

91b34346-dea0-44b9-933a-0c64f1ab66e3-2
01:00:28.997 --> 01:00:29.640
Foundation.

36686182-4bad-4889-b26c-53dd7aff8eaf-0
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.693
If not,
which agency would provide the services

36686182-4bad-4889-b26c-53dd7aff8eaf-1
01:00:33.693 --> 01:00:38.402
or to bring the development to
commercialization invested from the

36686182-4bad-4889-b26c-53dd7aff8eaf-2
01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:40.160
foundational investments?

1eb3400a-a782-4465-9cfc-b615b4152d3f-0
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.664
I can take this one, Yancheng,
if you could provide the specific patent

1eb3400a-a782-4465-9cfc-b615b4152d3f-1
01:00:51.664 --> 01:00:55.520
or IP portfolio you're speaking on,
that would be helpful.

f0c7c05c-80dd-4c4c-ade1-29677feba1e5-0
01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:00.883
From techniques perspective,
kind of where our jurisdiction ends is if

f0c7c05c-80dd-4c4c-ade1-29677feba1e5-1
01:01:00.883 --> 01:01:04.520
it's assigned to Department of Defence or
the VA.

e3bd7c5c-1e78-4b00-8e31-b18061671610-0
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.427
And so I'm not sure if this PBARF assigns
to the VA or if they own the IP

e3bd7c5c-1e78-4b00-8e31-b18061671610-1
01:01:10.427 --> 01:01:11.240
themselves.

8d6c8967-b4a5-4ea0-b706-13da8da0dc82-0
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.658
So from our perspective,
that's where it would kind of what would

8d6c8967-b4a5-4ea0-b706-13da8da0dc82-1
01:01:14.658 --> 01:01:16.560
delineate whether or not we can support.

c9989c4f-9003-48d9-b8d1-6f42d1aaa03f-0
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.840
But if you share that with me,
I can definitely look into that.

f9e87e2c-4723-4989-a49a-486207c57e52-0
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.000
I can also interject Tremonti,
we're not restricted.

47391f38-32de-494b-b0c8-62258aa3deda-0
01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.231
We are a private entity and we work,
we're on the,

47391f38-32de-494b-b0c8-62258aa3deda-1
01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:32.080
we're veteran owned and on the GSA list.

c59da43a-62f9-4dd1-aeb8-48081e9f1037-0
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.247
We work across all the agencies and we we
would love to take a look at your IP as

c59da43a-62f9-4dd1-aeb8-48081e9f1037-1
01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:40.880
well and see how we can assist you.

9e6ec4e0-1db1-4333-a136-77436e902e53-0
01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.160
Feel free to e-mail Julie or me.

03fceadf-610a-4cf0-b663-92e0d14064a8-0
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.320
Thank you.

68c71491-b710-4104-bbd7-67b7ed1720f2-0
01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.600
Thank you for the questions online,
thank you for joining us online.

fc919861-40f2-4088-8b55-d907f4cfe04f-0
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.688
Thank you for joining us in the room,
and thank you to the presenters for all

fc919861-40f2-4088-8b55-d907f4cfe04f-1
01:02:01.688 --> 01:02:02.840
of your information.

0028fb8c-2b30-42ec-bf22-2c43c41ec97f-0
01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.871
All of you have your contact information
on your slide decks and you will all get

0028fb8c-2b30-42ec-bf22-2c43c41ec97f-1
01:02:06.871 --> 01:02:08.040
copies of the slide deck.

234026c8-8918-43e8-8881-566a454977c4-0
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.431
So feel free to reach out to our
presenters if you have any additional

234026c8-8918-43e8-8881-566a454977c4-1
01:02:12.431 --> 01:02:14.720
questions that would you like to say?

d226b9d5-cfff-42f6-9181-f044cabfc252-0
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.090
Oh, just one,
two quick items from the another plug in

d226b9d5-cfff-42f6-9181-f044cabfc252-1
01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:20.480
for the actual incumbents on 16th June.

ef78e8ef-37a2-4a31-89e2-fec4228f19bb-0
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.112
And that there's two sessions that were
mentioned today on console products and

ef78e8ef-37a2-4a31-89e2-fec4228f19bb-1
01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:29.464
military and also establishing the Preda
because another advantage is that you,

ef78e8ef-37a2-4a31-89e2-fec4228f19bb-2
01:02:29.464 --> 01:02:33.327
if you're licensing the technology,
more than likely you'll be able to

ef78e8ef-37a2-4a31-89e2-fec4228f19bb-3
01:02:33.327 --> 01:02:37.571
establish a Preda so you can actually
work with the inventors if you're still

ef78e8ef-37a2-4a31-89e2-fec4228f19bb-4
01:02:37.571 --> 01:02:39.040
employed by the government.

835c3e6d-76c4-4728-8fdf-958de827849a-0
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.160
Thank you.

2450581a-93f8-443b-a558-a2ca1ef9464a-0
01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.320
And the agenda for the in conference is
online, so you can take a look at that.

e7685df9-20a5-42c9-bb08-3b689e19de90-0
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.680
It's at aimsats.com,
so you can look at all the great

e7685df9-20a5-42c9-bb08-3b689e19de90-1
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.640
programming.

c0cd3ffb-2369-4118-a2aa-8d39c113e668-0
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.400
So with that,
I would like to close out the day.

ee0bf974-40f4-450b-94c9-c61d4c207b98-0
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.160
I look forward to seeing you again in May.

68d3b867-8c20-48df-9903-8df3d58cdc1d-0
01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.960
May 19th is our next webinar.

c33714d9-0d51-4ada-9f74-2b103196a363-0
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:01.600
Have a good day.

f952b8aa-d777-44ae-b3b4-376e120192df-0
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

a17450ab-e8b0-4770-95f3-13a02d2eae79-0
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.360
Hey, thank you.

5850b244-b097-42c4-8c93-d8e07dcced5b-0
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:20.040
I don't know why it was no sound on the
velocity.

a901bc35-dcd8-45e8-a2c0-de1f895148d4-0
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.800
It was being broadcast, it was being,
it was being,

a901bc35-dcd8-45e8-a2c0-de1f895148d4-1
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.080
but it doesn't really work without sound.

f77ca11d-d851-4d62-afd7-4dd22d2623ea-0
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.000
No,
I don't think it was any sound online

f77ca11d-d851-4d62-afd7-4dd22d2623ea-1
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.400
either.

3213f72f-8853-4384-b176-db701d2514ab-0
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.120
There was sound inside the road that went
very well.

ada80e94-c3b3-427b-bfce-1e12d49000c0-0
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.240
Thank you.

f291deb6-53df-4e5a-869f-1a4efe5d2c80-0
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.680
It isn't good to see you.

203303c2-473c-400b-a868-e66ab7668de7-0
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920
Thank you for all your support.

5efa1efb-a86f-4949-ae0e-fc6103cd0d33-0
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:49.840
Oh, absolutely.

ffb8b9d5-2fd1-4c34-8520-f30a9ea97bf5-0
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:50.760
Yeah.

ef1077f0-4301-4bd4-b663-92d1387d2f55-0
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.200
Yeah.

3e9943be-4f22-4c7e-84ea-2b33418f9f03-0
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.800
Maybe we'll be there.

7098fb3b-2eec-48cc-b0eb-1e6ac56466d1-0
01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400
Maybe we'll be there.

bac3b5c1-b8ff-4830-aaea-c9861bc3be2c-0
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.400
Yeah, it's good.

80310edb-6042-4e50-a415-0d4aeae40e44-0
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.120
It will be.

1ca636f4-ad5a-419e-b7d2-a497d24f7dd4-0
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.320
So you are.
